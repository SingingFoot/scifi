Academic and Research Interests:

My PhD research, titled **"From Utopia to Dystopia: Ukrainian Science Fiction and the Collapse of Techno-Communism"**, explores Ukrainian science fiction as a form of intellectual resistance and philosophical inquiry. Key areas of focus include:

- Postcolonial Studies: Examining Ukraine as a cultural space under Russian oppression.
- Ukrainian Sci-Fi and Positivism: Analyzing its response to the rise and decline of Soviet positivist ideologies.
- Postmodern and Metamodern Shifts: Investigating literary transitions after the collapse of the USSR.
- Global Connections: Exploring how Ukrainian sci-fi interacts with and is influenced by global science fiction traditions.
Through my research, I aim to highlight the cultural and philosophical richness of Ukrainian science fiction and its relevance to understanding broader societal changes.

## Creative and Journalistic Achievements

I have authored six fiction books, including:

- **Kaharlyk** (2014), a satirical dystopia exploring identity in post-apocalyptic Ukraine.
- **The First Ukrainian Robots** (2016), a reflection on humanity and technology.
- **Cherep** (2017), an exploration the irrational roots of the so-called "Russian world", which led to the growth of aggression and militarization of modern Russian society.
- **Bandera Distortion** (2019), a provocative take on historical and cultural narratives.

My work has been published in both Ukrainian and English, with international recognition for my unique voice and perspective. Beyond literature, I have produced over 600 articles and 200+ radio podcasts, engaging with topics ranging from philosophy to human rights.

## Publications and Presentations

I am proud to have presented my research at international conferences, including:

- **Budapest Workshop on Philosophy and Technology 2023** (BudPT23): keynote "Science Fiction in Ukraine: 1920‚Äì2020."
- **Interdisciplinary Doctoral Student Conference 2024** (IDK2024): Award-winning presentation on "The Decline of Positivism in the 20th Century through Ukrainian Sci-Fi."

## Organizational and Leadership Experience

During my tenure as Public Relations Manager for the **Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union**, I organized numerous public events, including conferences, workshops, and outreach programs. I excel in event planning, communication, and fostering engagement, skills I now bring to my academic and professional endeavors.

## Why Ukrainian Sci-Fi?

Growing up in a society where philosophy was often censored, I found intellectual refuge in Ukrainian science fiction. Works by authors like Volodymyr Savchenko inspired me to explore profound philosophical questions, blending my love for literature and critical thinking. Today, I believe Ukrainian science fiction is not only a lens through which to understand the cultural history of Ukraine but also a key to its future as part of a vibrant, global intellectual community.
