## Sandro Kasyanyuk – Ukrainian Soviet Writer and Pioneer of Proto-Science Fiction

*Biographical Overview*

Sandro Kasyanyuk (presumably Alexander Kasyanyuk) was a Ukrainian Soviet writer of the 1920s, known for his early contributions to Ukrainian proto-science fiction. Little is known about his birth date, place of origin, or personal background. He was not a professional writer; instead, he worked as a factory worker at the **"Elektrosila"** plant in Kharkiv. Despite this, his literary works were highly regarded by contemporary critics, and he was associated with the Ukrainian proletarian literary organization **"Hart."**

Kasyanyuk's most notable work is the cycle of science fiction stories titled **"Omachynennia Liudstva"** ("The Mechanization of Humanity"), considered the first example of Ukrainian proto-science fiction.

## Literary Contributions and Influence

Though he did not pursue literature professionally, Kasyanyuk's works were recognized by literary critics of his time. The prominent Ukrainian literary scholar Oleksandr Biletsky believed that Kasyanyuk could have become *"the Ukrainian H.G. Wells with a proletarian ideology."* Another critic, Volodymyr Koriak, also appreciated Kasyanyuk’s works, considering them unique and thought-provoking. His writings have been analyzed by Vasyl Pivtoraadni (*"Ukrainian Literature of the Early Revolutionary Years (1917–1923),"* 1968) and Volodymyr (Walter) Smyrniw (*"Ukrainian Science Fiction: A Historical and Thematic Review,"* 2013).

Kasyanyuk's stories celebrated machines and technology, reflecting a naïve socialist utopianism. In his vision of the future, machines were almost living beings, majestic creations of the new world built by humanity. His characters believed in a better life under socialism, with aspirations to become engineers, machinists, or mechanics to serve society.

His works parallel the prose poetry of Aleksei Gastev, a key ideologist of the Proletkult movement, who viewed industrialization and mechanization as pathways to human progress.

## Science Fiction and Utopian Themes

Kasyanyuk’s short story **"Nova Utopiya"** ("A New Utopia") is regarded as one of the earliest examples of Ukrainian proto-science fiction, if not the first Ukrainian science fiction work. According to literary researcher Yaryna Tsymbal, the entire **"Omachynennia Liudstva"** cycle represents Ukrainian proto-science fiction.

In **"Nova Utopiya"**, the protagonist is transported through imagination into the Era of Machines, a distant future where technology has been seamlessly integrated into everyday communist life. On a massive ship that serves as a floating island, a traveler from the past witnesses the wonders of mechanization in a society where routine labor has been fully automated. Kasyanyuk’s vision portrays the future human as a master of nature and a conqueror of elemental forces, with his characters embracing mechanized labor over mundane, repetitive tasks.
