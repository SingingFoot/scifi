## Biography

### Early Life and Education  
Volodymyr Zayets was born into a family of civil servants in **Velyka Bugayivka, Vasylkiv Raion, Kyiv Oblast**. He pursued a medical career, graduating from the **Kyiv Medical Institute** in **1972**, specializing in **pediatrics**. After graduation, he worked as a **pediatrician** at the Vyshhorod Emergency Medical Center.

### Literary Career  
Zayets began his literary career with a **humorous short story** submitted to the satirical magazine *Perec* in **1972**. His first science fiction work, *Byli starogo kosmogatora* (1978), marked the beginning of a **humorous space adventure cycle** featuring Antoniy Endotelius, a cosmic wanderer and storyteller.

Throughout his career, he wrote in both **Ukrainian** and **Russian**, publishing in **Ukrainian magazines** (*Perec*, *Dnipro*, *Ranok*) and the **Leningrad-based journal Aurora**. He was actively involved in the Ukrainian science fiction community and participated in the **famous Maleevka science fiction seminar**.

In **1991**, Zayets became the **chief editor of the magazine "Flint"**, which only published one issue. During the **collapse of the Soviet Union**, he compiled an **anthology of Ukrainian science fiction, "Zemlya ne obetovannaya" (The Unpromised Land)**, but it was never published.

### Later Years and Mysterious Death  
In the late **1990s**, Zayets relocated to **Yemen**, working as a **pediatrician under contract**. He died under **mysterious circumstances** on **December 20, 2002**. The **official cause of death** was reported as **methanol poisoning**, but suspicions arose that he had been deliberately poisoned to avoid contract payment. His body was initially buried in Yemen, and his **wife, Lyudmyla Tkach**, struggled for months to have his remains repatriated to Ukraine. He was finally buried in **March 2003 in Kyiv**.

His son, who also became a doctor, **emigrated to the United States over 25 years ago**. Lyudmyla later joined their son in the U.S., and no known contacts remain with them.
