# My PhD: Exploring the Development of Ukrainian Science Fiction

The genre of Ukrainian science fiction (SF) has undergone significant transformations, shaped by the political, cultural, and technological shifts of each era. From its origins in the early 20th century to its contemporary manifestations, Ukrainian SF reflects a complex interplay of ideology, mysticism, and societal aspirations. My PhD research focuses on this dynamic evolution, exploring how the genre has mirrored and responded to the changing conditions of Ukrainian society.

## The Foundations of Ukrainian Science Fiction

Although fantastical elements in Ukrainian literature can be traced as far back as The Paterik of the Kievan Caves Monastery in the 13th century and later in the works of Peter Mohyla and Feofan Prokopovich, these texts do not qualify as science fiction. Science fiction as a genre emerged in response to the ideals of positivism, which held that scientific and technological progress was the ultimate path to human betterment. Positivism dismissed theological and metaphysical approaches, emphasizing practical, tangible advancements.

In Ukrainian SF, this philosophy became prominent in the 1920s, during a time of rapid industrialization and utopian socialist dreams. Authors like Sandro Kasyanyuk celebrated machines and technology, portraying humanity's partnership with these creations as essential to achieving a better socialist future. His cycle Machining Humanity reflects this optimism, describing harmonious coexistence between humans and machines. However, the genre's early works were deeply intertwined with Soviet propaganda, which often overshadowed the creative freedom of authors. This period saw a glorification of technological progress as a means to support communist ideals, even as cracks in the utopian vision began to appear.

## From Naive Optimism to Ideological Disillusionment

The optimistic view of technology in the 1920s reflected the ideals of techno-communism, a vision rooted in Marxist materialism and positivist thought. The belief that technological progress could lead to societal liberation and a classless utopia was a central theme in early Soviet Ukrainian science fiction. This vision is particularly evident in works like Solar Machine by Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Argonauts of the Universe by Volodymyr Vladko. These works embraced the idea that proletarians, empowered by advanced machinery, could triumph over the bourgeoisie and establish a communist utopia.

Sandro Kasyanyuk’s works, though less polished, represent an early and unique articulation of techno-communism in Ukrainian science fiction. His First Steps depicts a mechanic metaphorically entwined with the machines he operates, embodying the Marxist principle that human labor and technology could harmonize to achieve revolutionary change. In New Utopia, Kasyanyuk envisions a future where technological marvels effortlessly address all societal needs, reflecting the era’s unshaken faith in science and industrialization.

The end of this era in the 1960s marked a significant departure from the rigid framework of Soviet Ukrainian techno-communism. Authors began intertwining science fiction with mysticism and existential exploration. Oles Berdnyk stood out as a trailblazer, blending visionary themes and religious mysticism into his novels. His works challenged the dominant ideology by presenting alternative visions for humanity that transcended the boundaries of science and technology, leading to his imprisonment on two separate occasions.

## The Golden Age of Ukrainian Science Fiction

The 1970s and 1980s marked a Golden Age for Ukrainian science fiction. Free from the heavy-handed propaganda of earlier decades, writers focused on philosophical questions and explored new literary styles. Works from this era often grappled with issues of identity, morality, and the nature of existence. Volodymyr Savchenko's Self-Discovery tackled themes of cloning and individuality, prefiguring later postmodern explorations of identity. Similarly, Ihor Rosokhovatskyi's syhom trilogy, including The Guest and The Last Signal, questioned the relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence.

Yevhen Filimonov and Viktor Polozhiy also contributed to the genre with stories that blended scientific curiosity with existential dilemmas. Filimonov's The Ophthalmologist and The Music Box explored the psychological impacts of technology, while Polozhiy's Solar Wind delved into themes of memory, identity, and perception.

## Postmodernism and the Challenges of the 1990s
The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s brought economic hardship and a crisis of identity for Ukrainian writers. Many authors began writing in Russian to access larger markets, leading to a wave of re-Russification in Ukrainian science fiction. Writers like Boris Stern adopted postmodernist approaches, blending irony and satire with critiques of societal decay.

However, notable exceptions like Halyna Pahutyak resisted Russian cultural influences. Her novel The Servant from Dobromyl drew on Ukrainian folklore and mythology, portraying Soviet imperialism as a destructive force in contrast to the enduring power of Ukrainian traditions.

## The Metamodern Revolution of the 2010s

The 2010s brought about a metamodern revival in Ukrainian science fiction. Writers began incorporating elements of European and American SF traditions, blending them with local themes and concerns. Svetlana Taratorina's Lazarus used folklore and historical parallels to critique Russian chauvinism. Similarly, Maxim Gah's The Fifth Park offered a cyberpunk-inspired vision of a world where technocratic utopias have failed, creating spaces for surreal and poetic reflections on human existence.

## The Importance of My Research

By studying the evolution of Ukrainian science fiction, my research seeks to illuminate how literature reflects and shapes national identity. Ukrainian SF has oscillated between ideologies, from the naive optimism of techno-communism to the existential reflections of the Golden Age, and finally to the metamodernist experimentation of today. These shifts not only mirror the history of Ukraine but also reveal the profound ways in which fiction can respond to political and cultural challenges. Through this work, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of Ukrainian literature and its place within the global tradition of science fiction.
