# **Metamodernism Manifesto**

## **The reality has not become more complicated.**
We just started to notice more than before. At some point, this complexity of impressions increased so much that it exploded even before the Technological Singularity. 

The modern man reminds a patient of **Asperger’s Syndrome**, who notices all the smallest details of the environment at once, and this knowledge so distracts him (or her) that he (or she) is no longer able to grasp the whole. He (or she) gathers a large collection of photo cameras without any interest in photography. Such an accumulation of information leads to the emergence of a new hybrid consciousness, which combines inseparable, opposite, antagonistic phenomena and in general everything that the eyes can catch and the ears can hear. Hence, a new form of artistic method and a new metaphorical apparatus of understanding reality emerges.

## **The Position of the Artist and Trust in Reality**

**Realists** only trust what they can see.
>  - Childe Harold went on his pilgrimage to touch everything with his own hands.
>  - Mr. Pickwick, “with a spyglass in his coat pocket, and a notebook ready to take to his pages any discovery worthy of attention,” is obsessed with observing and documenting.

**Modernists** trust only what they cannot see.
>  - Malevich and his followers saw meaning only in reproducing a **non-existent** reality.
>  - Adolf Hitler believed in a **non-existent** Jewish plot, and Joseph Stalin in a **mythical** class struggle.

**Postmodernists** trust nothing.
>  - Samuel Beckett, hiding from the Gestapo in Natalie Sarrot’s house, wrote *Watt* not about fascism or anti-fascism, but about reality losing its meaning.
>  - Language had turned into whitening, making all words equally unconvincing.

**Metamodernists** trust everything.
>  - In Wes Anderson’s films, **everything** is true.
>  - Dogs and foxes really talk, all events are interconnected, and every object moves in a perfect **symmetrical** and **nested** fashion.

## **Metamodernism is Always Counterintuitive**

If you think you **know** something exactly, it is **not** true at all. 

This is the **radical contradiction** of metamodernism with romanticism, which relied entirely on **intuitive insights**. However, Google and the careful documentation of reality by millions of people have put an **end** to all insights. Everything is now **verifiable**, and accuracy depends on the **number of checks**.

Getting stuck in romantic and modernist traditions raises many problems:

- Some countries and individuals **still exist** in the paradigm of romanticism or modernism.
- The **modern metamodernist** person will **always** shock the bearers of the romantic ideal.
- To exist in a situation of **metamodernism** is very **uncomfortable**.

To acknowledge modernity and escape the **sweet captivity** of archaic consciousness, one must constantly make a **substantial effort**, which Romantics are **incapable** of, as it challenges their **idealistic model**.

## **The Value of Authorial Purity and the Ideal of Metamodernism**

The phenomenon of **authorial purity** is prevalent among **literary critics**:

- **Romantic-Realistic Ideal**: Literature is a sharp reflection of life but rejects **naturalism** and **play**, essential elements of life.
- **Modernist Ideal**: Linked to **nationalism**, demands **homogeneity** and revolutionary ideals.
- **Postmodernist Ideal**: Based on **pop-patterns**, irony, and **self-awareness**.
- **Metamodernist Ideal**: Constant **oscillation** between all previous paradigms, recognizing **no hierarchy**.

Metamodernism should look like **nightmarish chaos**, but instead, it preserves **snippets**, small **interludes** that prevent confusion.

## **Snippets in Metamodernism**

Snippets, in **Wes Anderson’s** *Moonrise Kingdom*, represent a **Western cultural phenomenon**:

Suzy Bishop carries six books she borrowed but never returned:

1. *Shelly and the Secret Universe*
2. *The Francine Odysseys*
3. *The Girl from Jupiter*
4. *Disappearance of the 6th Grade*
5. *The Light of Seven Matchsticks*
6. *The Return of Auntie Lorraine*

None of these books **exist**. Anderson **invented** them and wrote **snippets** to cite in the film.

## **Fast Notion About Metamodern**

Imagine a household that **throws away all belongings** and asks an artist to create something valuable using them. However, the result should **not look like a collage**, but as if it were **newly purchased**.

- *“Have you gone mad? Who will believe this is new?”* asks the artist.
- *“We will believe. Just wash it, wipe it… Make it shine.”*
- *“But you will recognize your own things!”* 
- *“No, we won’t. We’ve forgotten how they looked.”*

This is **metamodernism**.

## **Triad of Uncertainty**

Much conflict in the modern world arises from a **misunderstanding** of its **nature**. The three main principles of **metamodernism**:

1. **There are no longer things that cannot be funny.**
2. **There are no such things as are defined in such a way that they can be said to be certain.**
3. **There are no things that can be said to be in place.**

## **This Manifesto is Open to Further Additions**

This manifesto can be **expanded**, **detailed**, or **completely denied**—in full agreement with **metamodernism itself**.
