# **Metamodernism Manifesto**

## **The reality has not become more complicated.**

We just started to notice more than before. At some point, this complexity of impressions increased so much that it exploded even before the Technological Singularity. 

The modern man reminds a patient of **Asperger’s Syndrome**, who notices all the smallest details of the environment at once, and this knowledge so distracts him (or her) that he (or she) is no longer able to grasp the whole. He (or she) gathers a large collection of photo cameras without any interest in photography. Such an accumulation of information leads to the emergence of a new hybrid consciousness, which combines inseparable, opposite, antagonistic phenomena and in general everything that the eyes can catch and the ears can hear. Hence, a new form of artistic method and a new metaphorical apparatus of understanding reality emerges.

## **The Position of the Artist and Trust in Reality**

**Realists** only trust what they can see.
>  - Childe Harold went on his pilgrimage to touch everything with his own hands.
>  - Mr. Pickwick, “with a spyglass in his coat pocket, and a notebook ready to take to his pages any discovery worthy of attention,” is obsessed with observing and documenting.

**Modernists** trust only what they cannot see.
>  - Malevich and his followers saw meaning only in reproducing a **non-existent** reality.
>  - Adolf Hitler believed in a **non-existent** Jewish plot, and Joseph Stalin in a **mythical** class struggle.

**Postmodernists** trust nothing.
>  - Samuel Beckett, hiding from the Gestapo in Natalie Sarrot’s house, wrote *Watt* not about fascism or anti-fascism, but about reality losing its meaning.
>  - Language had turned into whitening, making all words equally unconvincing.

**Metamodernists** trust everything.
>  - In Wes Anderson’s films, **everything** is true.
>  - Dogs and foxes really talk, all events are interconnected, and every object moves in a perfect **symmetrical** and **nested** fashion, and nested ninety degrees in exquisite nolling.

## **Metamodernism is Always Counterintuitive**

If you think you **know** something exactly, it is **not** true at all. 

This is the **radical contradiction** of metamodernism with romanticism, which relied entirely on **intuitive insights**. However, Google and the careful documentation of reality by millions of people have put an **end** to all insights. Everything is now **verifiable**, and accuracy depends on the **number of checks**.

Getting stuck in romantic and modernist traditions raises many problems:

- Some countries and individuals **still exist** in the paradigm of romanticism or modernism.
- The **modern metamodernist** person will **always** shock the bearers of the romantic ideal.
- To exist in a situation of **metamodernism** is very **uncomfortable**.

To acknowledge modernity and escape the **sweet captivity** of archaic consciousness, one must constantly make a **substantial effort**, which Romantics are **incapable** of, as it challenges their **idealistic model**.

## **The Value of Authorial Purity and the Ideal of Metamodernism**

![Metamodernism Manifesto - The Value of Authorial Purity and the Ideal of Metamodernism](/assets/images/meta/3.png) 

The phenomenon of the value of the author’s purity is very widespread among literary critics. Purity is a set of specific characteristics of the direction. An author must comply with them in order to be acclaimed by a critic. The impurity of another’s paradigm is felt by the critic literally as dirt. This is the source of mutual contempt. It is similar to the caste system in ancient India.

Each time there are different forms of purity. There are romantic-realistic, modernist, postmodern and metamodern ideals of purity.

- **The realistic ideal** sees literature as a witty and sharp reflection of life, but it rejects naturalism and play, which are essential elements of life.

- **The modernist ideal** is directly linked to nationalism, and therefore implies the maximum homogenization and unification of the creative method. From the point of view of the modernist critic, the ideal author should be a revolutionary, but he must create a homogeneous reality: it may be, for example, a revolutionary novel about the victory of a national identity in the territory of a country and abroad. The work must necessarily be about the struggle of identities as broad representations of the mass consciousness. Individual characters should only be temporary embodiments of identities that essentially solve nothing, as opposed to a romantic-realistic ideal where individual identities always solve everything.

- **The post-modernist ideal** is based on the skillful application of the various pop-patterns that the author must possess at the highest level and construct the fabric of the work, using the irony to maintain a certain distance, so that the reader does not feel impressed with the self-sufficiency of these patterns, because they are not hands, but only gloves (or glove dolls) that are temporarily worn on the hands.

- **The metamodern ideal** is the constant oscillation of the sample, and it is very similar to post-modernism, but there is one very significant difference: for the metamodernist there is no difference between the hands and gloves (between the puppet’s hand and the puppet). All previous designs — both romantic, realistic, modernist and post-modernist — have the same value for him and can exist both alternately and simultaneously. It should look like nightmarish chaos, but everyone saves snippets (formerly called interludes) into which the author simply channels the specimens to avoid confusion. In general, metamodenism is a very uncomfortable phenomenon, because it is counterintuitive, does not recognize any hierarchy, and its constant oscillation leads to the fact that it is often not clear what is happening: one wants the author to finally dwell on something alone, but in metamodernism this is simply not possible.

Metamodernism should look like **nightmarish chaos**, but instead, it preserves **snippets**, small **interludes** that prevent confusion.

## **Snippets in Metamodernism**

Snippets, in **Wes Anderson’s** *Moonrise Kingdom*, represent a **Western cultural phenomenon**:

Suzy Bishop carries six books she borrowed but never returned:

1. *Shelly and the Secret Universe*
2. *The Francine Odysseys*
3. *The Girl from Jupiter*
4. *Disappearance of the 6th Grade*
5. *The Light of Seven Matchsticks*
6. *The Return of Auntie Lorraine*

![Metamodernism Manifesto - Suzy Bishop's books](/assets/images/meta/5.png) 

None of these books actually exist. Anderson came up with all these names and wrote snippets of these books to cite aloud in the movie. The artists commissioned by the director painted the covers. All of these books are fantasy novels for teenage girls. Such novels occupy a significant place in English-speaking culture, so much so that they have already begun to transcend their traditional area of existence. For example, British singer and leader of **The Cure** band **Robert Smith** used the figurative system of fantasy novel of **Penelope Farmer** *“Charlotte Sometimes”* for one of his songs of the same title.

Of course, snippets have existed in art for a very long time, but only in metamodernism they are always simulated by the author, present in large numbers and characterized by excessive detailization.

## **Fast Notion About Metamodern**

In order to quickly get a fairly accurate idea of ​​the metamodern, one has to imagine the inhabitants of a certain house, who threw away all their belongings in the trash, and instructed the artist to create something of value, but necessarily with the use of each thing and so that everything would not look like a collage or an assembly, but would remind of something new and quality that had just been purchased at the store. The artist says to this, 

*“Have you gone mad? Who will believe that this is a new and quality thing?”* 

*“Take it easy,”* said the owners of the thrown things, *“we will believe. You just wash there, wipe it … here, see, the rag lies? Wipe with the rag. To make it shine a little and look like new.”* 

*“But you will recognize your things!”*, the artist wonders. 

*“We won’t recognize,”* the owners of the things respond, *“because we’ve forgotten how they looked. There’s an old man here. He remembers something. But nobody listens to him.”*

## **Triad of Uncertainty**

Much conflict in the modern world arises from a **misunderstanding** of its **nature**. The three main principles of **metamodernism**:

1. **There are no longer things that cannot be funny.**
2. **There are no such things as are defined in such a way that they can be said to be certain.**
3. **There are no things that can be said to be in place.**

## **This Manifesto is Open to Further Additions**

This manifesto can be **expanded**, **detailed**, or **completely denied**—in full agreement with **metamodernism itself**.
