The early 20<sup>th</sup> century saw the emergence of Sandro Kasyanyuk, an industrial worker-turned-writer who pioneered Ukrainian proto-science fiction with his cycle Omachynennia Liudstva (The Mechanization of Humanity). His works reflected a na\u00efve socialist utopianism, glorifying machines and portraying humans as mere operators of technology in the socialist future.</p> <p>The 1920s and 1930s were marked by communist propaganda-driven SF, with works like Volodymyr Vladko\u2019s Iron Rebellion and Aero-torpedos Turn Back, which promoted Soviet superiority and global communist revolution. Dmytro Buzko's Crystal Paradise depicted a utopian USSR built through scientific progress. However, the era also saw the tragic fate of Geo Shkurupii, a futurist writer executed during Stalinist purges.</p> <p>By the 1940s and 1950s, Ukrainian SF transitioned into \"short-sighted fiction\", where novels like Mykola Trublaini's The Deep Path and Vasyl Berezhny\u2019s To the Starry Worlds focused on technological advancements within the framework of Soviet ideology, often portraying the West as an antagonist.</p> <p>The 1960s introduced a new wave of Ukrainian SF, moving away from strict positivism towards mysticism and cosmic philosophy. Oles Berdnyk, a dissident and visionary writer, became known as a \"hippie-cosmist,\" blending science fiction with spiritual and nationalist elements. His novel The Star Corsair explored Ukrainian identity in the cosmic future, presenting an alternative to communist materialism.</p> <p>Ukrainian SF writers have consistently reflected the political and ideological struggles of their time, from industrial utopianism to dystopian critiques of totalitarianism.

As the project has a significant degree of complexity, I quickly realized that I was in need of good user documentation.</p> <p>After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs in particular, I quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use. Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated and given that I'm a very visual person, I just couldn't convince myself to call it a day.</p> <p>I had to build a theme.</p> <p>Months later, in February 2016, I released the first version of Material for MkDocs (and with it, protobluff, the project I wanted to release in the first place), and it looked like this:</p> <p></p> <p>It was already fully responsive and overall, well, quite okayish, but barely customizable, as only the logo could be changed.

We've looked at alternative JavaScript-based libraries to keep our client-side search, but none met our requirements or lived up to our expectations.</p> <p>To address these challenges, we've embarked on developing a new search system from first principles that not only matches but already exceeds the capabilities of Lunr.js. Built from the ground up, this system is faster, more compact, and most importantly: modular. It is based on a growing core evolving around two core concepts we isolated to be essential \u2013 engines and plugins \u2013 allowing for flexible configuration and assembly of components like text indexing, vector embeddings, filtering, ranking, highlighting, and more. Every part of it can be replaced or extended, enabling users to tailor the search system to their specific needs.</p> <p>Our new search system, which we will release as a separate MIT-licensed Open Source project, is designed to handle a wide range of scenarios \u2014 from small blogs to large documentation projects. Of course, it supports offline use and integrates seamlessly with both client and server environments. The advanced ranking system provides fine-tuned control, and integration with third-party services is now more straightforward.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 Empower users to quickly find the information they need while freeing authors from managing external services, by providing a search system that adapts to diverse content types.</p> <p>You might wonder why it's not yet available. The process of developing this system from scratch and uncovering its potential has led us to re-evaluate core concepts of Material for MkDocs. As a result, we've decided to postpone the release of the new search system to integrate it into the broader update that we've started to work on. If you keep on reading, you'll learn about further reasons why we've decided to follow this approach.</p> <p>We're excited to share more details about this update in one of the next posts in this series.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#translations-and-versioning","title":"Translations and versioning","text":"<p>Supporting multi-language sites in MkDocs is the most requested feature on our discussion board and in conversations with users, yet it presents significant challenges, as MkDocs does not natively support it. The same applies to versioning, which also involves synchronisation of multi-project builds. While the MkDocs ecosystem has developed various plugins and tools to address these issues, there is still substantial untapped potential. We began exploring these areas but quickly encountered problems that hindered our progress.</p> <p>As you may know, our initial effort involved the projects plugin that aims to extend MkDocs to add support for multi-project environments as a solid foundation to support multi-language sites and versioning. Unfortunately, we encountered significant challenges due to MkDocs' internal architecture and design constraints, which we're working actively on resolving.<sup>5</sup></p> <p> Goal \u2013 Enable scaling documentation to any size or team structure by offering seamless methods for integrating multiple documentation projects, whether they involve different languages, versions, or distinct sections of an overall body of work.</p> <p>As a result, we are developing a new approach to offer a more comprehensive and robust solution for both multi-language support and versioning. This new approach also intersects with adjacent functionalities like search, as many of our users are interested in federated search capabilities that combine results from multiple documentation sites into a unified search interface. Overcoming this challenge is one of the major hurdles we need to address before releasing the new search system.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#editing-and-collaboration","title":"Editing and collaboration","text":"<p>We had considered developing a live editor in response to MkDocs' performance issues with large projects, which in most cases stem from compute-intensive plugins that don't employ caching. A proof of concept based on Pyodide (= running Python in the browser) generated significant interest among users and prompted many organizations and individuals to share their collaborative workflows for feedback. Sadly, implementing this live editor proved to be very challenging, as it would require rebuilding substantial parts of MkDocs.<sup>6</sup> After discontinuing work on this approach, our progress with multi-project support has renewed our belief that we can finally solve the sluggish editing experience that was reported several times over the last years.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>This brings us to collaboration, which wasn't initially on our list of priorities. However, throughout 2024, conversations with various organizations and maintainers of popular Open Source projects highlighted a frequent request for enhanced collaboration features. Many users expressed a need for capabilities that would allow non-technical team members to suggest and make changes to the documentation. We're genuinely grateful for this feedback, as it has come at a pivotal time. We recognize the need to streamline tracking and discussing changes, as well as to facilitate drive-by contributions.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 Everyone, regardless of their technical skill level, can easily work on and improve the documentation and contribute to a growing corpus of knowledge.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>This focus on collaboration aligns with how knowledge is managed in enterprises. In large organizations, documentation often exists in information silos \u2014 decentralized yet essential repositories of information. We understand the need to be able to unify these disparate sources into a coherent body of knowledge while preserving decentralized ownership. This also nicely aligns with our previously outlined work on multi-project support, as well as the new search system to implement federated search among multiple projects.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#large-language-models-llms","title":"Large Language Models (LLMs)","text":"<p>Almost a year ago, we introduced an experimental chatbot on our documentation site. It quickly became one of the most anticipated features, with users requesting the ability to deploy similar functionality on their own sites, underscoring the growing demand for interactive documentation tools. However, we found that adding to the myriad of existing chat solutions and simply building another thin wrapper on top of ChatGPT is nonsense.</p> <p> Goal \u2013 We're envisioning creating a unified interface that seamlessly integrates advanced search, chat, and summarization features, providing an interactive documentation experience.</p> <p>As we delved into this ambitious project, we gained valuable insights from user feedback. Users began interacting with the chatbot in their native languages, an outcome we hadn't anticipated given that our documentation is in English. Remarkably (or obviously to those that work on LLMs year round), the chatbot responded in the same language. This ability of LLMs is one of the genuinely exciting features of these machine learning models as it has the potential to improve the accessibility of the documentation. However, while we employed state-of-the-art RAG methodologies, the results were mixed, and occasional hallucinations surfaced.</p> <p>These experiences led us to prioritize enhancing our search capabilities before integrating LLM-based features.

Many of the initiatives we've discussed represent foundational work that will set the stage for much more ambitious and innovative features. Once these core elements are in place, we'll deliver a range of exciting new functionalities that align with our vision and goals.</p> <p>In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details about our plans and how they will contribute to our overarching objectives. While growth and innovation are at the forefront of our plans, we want to assure you that our core values remain unchanged. We are committed to maintaining the principles that have guided us thus far, ensuring that our growth is both healthy and consistent:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Against recent industry trends with companies moving away from core ideas of Open Source, we are doubling down on our commitment to Open Source because we believe it's at the heart of the value proposition of our work and the docs as code approach.</p> </li> <li> <p>Our organic approach to growth is part of this strategy as it keeps us independent of individual funding sources and pressures to provide a return on investment, which is what causes many other projects to turn away from the principles of Open Source.</p> </li> <li> <p>Likewise, we are driven by the needs of the community for a rich ecosystem of adaptations of the core framework. Extensibility and modularity are key for this and we are working hard to improve the developer experience by providing clear interfaces.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Stay tuned for updates as we continue to build on our progress and explore new possibilities. We're excited about the future and look forward to sharing more with you as we advance.</p> <p>Martin, Alex and Kathi </p> <ol> <li> <p>We've collected invaluable feedback from enterprises and other Open Source maintainers, which revealed that the actual numbers are even higher. Many organizations leverage the framework within private infrastructures, such as self-hosted platforms like GitLab, for internal knowledge management. This suggests that the true reach of Material for MkDocs extends far beyond what is publicly visible.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The built-in plugins that Material for MkDocs ships perfectly outline this principle, as they are complementary to each other and can be used in combination to build sophisticated pipelines. This modular design allows users to pick and choose the features they need, ensuring that the framework remains lightweight and flexible.</p> <p>For instance, the privacy plugin can work together with the optimize plugin so that external assets can be passed through the same optimization pipeline as the rest of your documentation. This means you can store and edit unoptimized files outside of your repository, and let both plugins automatically build an optimized site for you.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Boosting documents in BM25 can lead to challenges, particularly with a changing corpus of documents. Relevance is calculated based on term frequency and the importance of terms across the entire corpus. Boosting a document involves adjusting its weight to make it more prominent in search results.</p> <p>As new documents are added or existing ones are modified, the overall distribution of term frequencies and their importance can shift. This recalibration can diminish the effectiveness of the boost, making it harder to maintain consistent ranking across a changing dataset. Essentially, the boosted documents may not stay as prominent or relevant as intended, leading to imbalances and scalability issues in search results.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Lunr.js uses JavaScript objects to index and manage search data, which introduces inefficiencies due to how JavaScript engines handle object operations. JavaScript engines optimize performance using techniques like inline caching and object shape optimization. However, these optimizations rely on predictable and consistent object structures.</p> <p>The dynamic nature of Lunr.js' indexing \u2014 where documents can have varying structures \u2014 prevents the engine from applying these optimizations effectively. This means that while JavaScript engines can optimize for fixed, predictable object structures, they struggle with the polymorphic and fluid nature of Lunr.js's indexing, leading to performance issues as the amount of data grows.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>When developing the projects plugin, we initially made good progress, including adding support for nested projects and allowing for a tree structure where sub-projects can have further sub-projects. However, we quickly encountered difficulties, particularly with cross-project navigation. To illustrate, imagine that each project can link to any other project, which makes handling these interconnections complex, especially when dealing with circular dependencies \u2014 such as Project A linking to Project B and vice versa.</p> <p>Implementing multi-project support in MkDocs is particularly challenging due to the lack of an official programmatic API, which complicates efforts to extend its functionality. Moreover, resolving navigation issues before building projects is crucial for ensuring proper interconnectivity. These challenges combined made the development of the projects plugin a complex endeavor.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Our proof of concept supported some features of Material for MkDocs but didn't cover them all. For instance, integrating support for icons or linking between documents would have necessitated reimplementing parts of MkDocs to bypass a full rebuild \u2014 something we obviously wanted to avoid. Additionally, certain links, such as those to blog posts generated from schemas, are not merely translated but computed dynamically, which means they cannot be inferred by replacing the <code>.md</code> extension with <code>.html</code>.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>After we raised this issue with the maintainers of MkDocs again<sup>8</sup>, and maintainership changed mid 2024, work on a ground-up rewrite that aims to address slow reloads by rendering only the page currently being built has started. It's still unclear how this rewrite will integrate with the requirements of existing plugins. Complex plugins such as mkdocstrings, or our built-in blog and tags plugins require a coordinated build of all pages to accurately resolve links between pages and to computed resources, which cannot be determined without building the entire project.</p> <p>Update: The new maintainer now publicly stated that he's working towards a new version of MkDocs that does not require or support plugins, and mentions it will be equally capable through offering customization via templating, themes, and styling, which he also mentioned to us and several other users in a team call on August 1. In this call, we raised objections multiple times in regards to how this will impact the ecosystem, to no avail. No intention or roadmap for plugin support was provided. This development is orthogonal to our goal empowering users and organizations to adapt the core framework to their requirements by the means of modularity. We're working on resolving this situation, and will provide a way forward for our community.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Previously raised issues include #2418, #2384, and #1900.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>We are actively aligning our future development efforts to address this, recognizing it as a key area for improvement. While it's not something we can deliver immediately, we are committed to making this vision a reality in our work.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li>

Science fiction as a genre emerged in response to the ideals of positivism, which held that scientific and technological progress was the ultimate path to human betterment. Positivism dismissed theological and metaphysical approaches, emphasizing practical, tangible advancements.</p> <p>In Ukrainian SF, this philosophy became prominent in the 1920s, during a time of rapid industrialization and utopian socialist dreams. Authors like Sandro Kasyanyuk celebrated machines and technology, portraying humanity's partnership with these creations as essential to achieving a better socialist future. His cycle Machining Humanity reflects this optimism, describing harmonious coexistence between humans and machines. However, the genre's early works were deeply intertwined with Soviet propaganda, which often overshadowed the creative freedom of authors. This period saw a glorification of technological progress as a means to support communist ideals, even as cracks in the utopian vision began to appear.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/#from-naive-optimism-to-ideological-disillusionment","title":"From Naive Optimism to Ideological Disillusionment","text":"<p>The optimistic view of technology in the 1920s reflected the ideals of techno-communism, a vision rooted in Marxist materialism and positivist thought. The belief that technological progress could lead to societal liberation and a classless utopia was a central theme in early Soviet Ukrainian science fiction. This vision is particularly evident in works like Solar Machine by Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Argonauts of the Universe by Volodymyr Vladko. These works embraced the idea that proletarians, empowered by advanced machinery, could triumph over the bourgeoisie and establish a communist utopia.</p> <p>Sandro Kasyanyuk\u2019s works, though less polished, represent an early and unique articulation of techno-communism in Ukrainian science fiction. His First Steps depicts a mechanic metaphorically entwined with the machines he operates, embodying the Marxist principle that human labor and technology could harmonize to achieve revolutionary change. In New Utopia, Kasyanyuk envisions a future where technological marvels effortlessly address all societal needs, reflecting the era\u2019s unshaken faith in science and industrialization.</p> <p>The end of this era in the 1960s marked a significant departure from the rigid framework of Soviet Ukrainian techno-communism. Authors began intertwining science fiction with mysticism and existential exploration. Oles Berdnyk stood out as a trailblazer, blending visionary themes and religious mysticism into his novels. His works challenged the dominant ideology by presenting alternative visions for humanity that transcended the boundaries of science and technology, leading to his imprisonment on two separate occasions.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/#the-golden-age-of-ukrainian-science-fiction","title":"The Golden Age of Ukrainian Science Fiction","text":"<p>The 1970s and 1980s marked a Golden Age for Ukrainian science fiction.

Volodymyr Savchenko's Self-Discovery tackled themes of cloning and individuality, prefiguring later postmodern explorations of identity. Similarly, Ihor Rosokhovatskyi's syhom trilogy, including The Guest and The Last Signal, questioned the relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Yevhen Filimonov and Viktor Polozhiy also contributed to the genre with stories that blended scientific curiosity with existential dilemmas.

The first fantastic work written in the territory of modern Ukraine, so-called because it features descriptions of otherworldly creatures, is The Paterik of the Kievan Caves Monastery (Heppell 1989)\u2014a collection of stories from the thirteenth century about the foundation of the Kyiv-Pechersk Monastery and the everyday lives of its first inhabitants. Some works of Peter Mohyla of the seventeenth century are defined as fantastic as well. The Cossack Chronicles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries contain stories about folklore creatures; some researchers refer to these as the predecessors of Ukrainian horror literature. Feofan Prokopovich's ([1705] 1961) tragicomedy Volodymyr, created at the beginning of the eighteenth century, contains fantastical elements. All this, of course, is no Ukrainian SF for two reasons:</p> Sci-Fi literature appeared as a reaction to positivism <p>Positivism claims that neither theological nor metaphysical thinking will bring humanity the desired results; both ways of thinking are, in fact, illusions and self-deception. Positivism convincingly proved that only scientific and technological progress has tangible, useful results.</p> <p>This view is pure illusion, and at the end of the twentieth century there was what I call the \u201ccollapse of positivism,\u201d which even gave rise to a new SF genre that we call cyberpunk. But you can get an idea of the popularity of these views if you read the letters of well-known Ukrainian intellectual Ivan Franko (1856-1916) to translator Olga Roshkevich (Franko [1878] 1986):</p> <p>\"I am convinced that a great, worldwide revolution will slowly destroy the cur- rent order and establish a new one. By the word[s] \u201cworld revolution\u201d I do not mean a worldwide revolt of the poor against the rich, a worldwide massacre; this can be understood as a revolution only by the world\u2019s policemen, who do not know that the invention of steam engines, telegraphs, phonographs, micro- phones, electric machines, etc., introduces a revolution in the world almost as big as the entire bloody French revolution.\"</p> <p>Franko speaks here as a typical positivist. He hopes that electric machinery will not only change people\u2019s lives for the better but also make people better.</p> <p>Walter Smyrniw (2013) tried to define SF literature in his work Ukrainian Science Fiction: Historical and Thematic Perspectives, but he never managed to do it. And in my opinion, it is very simple: Science fiction literature is an artistic reaction to the spread and the collapse of positivism.</p> <p>In total, there are three types of knowledge about reality: theological, metaphys- ical, and positivist. At the beginning of the twentieth century, it became clear to the most progressive people of this time that theological and metaphysical ways of knowing reality are unproductive. You cannot build a locomotive or an airplane by praying or reading Kant\u2019s works; it requires science and technology. Hence the idea that science and technology are not only an ideal way of knowing reality but will also quickly bring maximum positive (or practical) results. Such an idea in literature led to the appearance of SF.</p> <p>But at the end of the twentieth century, it became clear that, although science and technology are quite productive, they bring not only positive but also negative results. We can call this understanding \u201cthe collapse of positivism.\u201d But, apart from positivism, no other productive ideas were found, which caused a feeling of frustration and hopelessness about the future. This feeling became the impetus for the revival of initially various forms of mysticism (if technology does not bring happiness, then one must open the third eye and go into the astral) and cyberpunk, which depicts a society that has reached a dead end due to positivism.</p> The Origins of Literary Ukrainian and the Absence of Early Ukrainian Science Fiction <p>Literary Ukrainian language appeared at the end of the eighteenth century after the publication of Ivan Kotlyarevsky\u2019s  Aeneid, a burlesque-travesty poem based on the plot of the classic poem of the same name by Roman poet Virgil.</p> <p>Using these two reasons as filters, we can say that Ukrainian SF did not exist un- til the beginning of the twentieth century. After all, although Kotlyarevsky\u2019s Aeneid has fantastic elements, all of them are far from the instructions of positivism. Like- wise, Jan Potocki\u2019s fantasy-philosophical novel The Manuscript Found in Saragossa (Potocki [1815] 2015) is often called the first Ukrainian fantasy novel, but Potocki, although he lived in the territory of modern Ukraine, was a Pole, and wrote his novel in French. The same applies to Mykola Gogol: although he was born in Ukraine, all his works were written in Russian and also had nothing to do with positivism.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-one/#the-1920s-sandro-kasianyuk-and-red-roaring-twenties-positivism","title":"The 1920s: Sandro Kasianyuk and \u201cRed Roaring Twenties\u201d Positivism","text":"In search of the first Ukrainian SF, it is worth paying attention to the authors of the 1920s. <p>In search of the first Ukrainian SF, it is worth paying attention to the authors of the 1920s.

This author\u2019s real name was Oleksandr, but he shortened it according to the \u201cmodernist\u201d fashion of the time. He was not professionally engaged in writing; in everyday life, he was a simple worker at the Kharkiv \u201cElectrosila\u201d plant. Literary critic Oleksandr Biletsky believed that Kasianyuk could very well become the \u201cUkrainian Wells with proletarian ideology\u201d (Biletsky 1926, 122). Kasianyuk is also mentioned in the work of Volodymyr (Walter) Smyrniw (2013).</p> <p>The dream of flying, becoming a train driver, learning to be a locksmith, a mechanic, an engineer in order to serve the people\u2014this is the pathos of Kasianyuk\u2019s works. Man and machine, according to the author, are true friends: \u201cAnd look how kindly they treat each other\u201d; they have \u201ccommon interests.\u201d Promoting the advantages of the wireless telegraph, Kasianyuk tells about a telegraph-radio operator who \u201clives in a huge thousands of millions space\u201d thanks to the discoveries of science. The story \u201cNew Utopia\u201d glorifies the greatness of technical reconstruction in the seaport, machines and cranes, electric plows, and a \u201cfarming school\u201d brought to \u201chigher degrees\u201d on some unknown island (Kasianyuk 1926).</p> <p>Kasianyuk\u2019s works are full of na\u00efve socialist utopianism; they glorify machines and technology. The man of the future in Kasianyuk\u2019s works is \u201conly a pointer, only a guide\u201d (Biletsky 1926, 123) for this technique. Kasianyuk\u2019s heroes are inspired by ideas for a better life in a socialist society.</p> <p>The plot of the novel Atom in Harness (Blum and Rosen [1929] 2017) is very indicative of that weird cocktail of Russian imperialist and communist propaganda that shaped the consciousness of Ukrainian authors of those times. The novel was written by an unknown writer under the pseudonym Blum and Rosen. The novel takes place in 1939. Humanity is divided between the bloc of Soviet (communist) countries (USSR, China, India, and Germany) and the capitalist bloc (the rest of the world). Capitalist countries formed a kind of federation and parliament in the city of Wellington (the capital of New Zealand). The world capitalist government is called \u201cthe Cabinet of Military Affairs and Espionage\u201d (Blum and Rosen [1929] 2017) and also sits in Wellington. This government considers the creation of a radio curtain from the radio transmitters of the USSR to be its main task. The transmitters are obviously broadcasting political propaganda from Moscow for the establishment of a world revolution, as Leo Trotsky dreamed about it. For this purpose, on the borders with the Soviet Union, large balloons with powerful radio stations, which broadcast jazz around the clock, are installed at different heights in the air. This creates a noise wall at the borders, which does not allow radio signals from the USSR to capitalist countries.</p> <p>The Soviet party leadership perfectly understands that Western liberal culture can create the impression among the youth of the countries occupied by the Moscow invaders that life outside the USSR is not as terrible and hopeless as Soviet propaganda portrays it. For this purpose, a whole campaign of opposition to Western culture is organized, banning certain artists and styles of music, even clothing: a famous story recounts two businessmen in Moscow being executed for trying to sell jeans. For some reason, jazz music causes special hatred among the Soviet authorities. The propagandists even come up with a poetic slogan: \u201cToday you play jazz, and tomorrow you will sell the Motherland.\u201d The Soviet people should have remembered that jazz is very dangerous because it can distract from the struggle against capitalism.</p> <p>The novel begins with the attempt of a young Moscow scientist Zhuravlyov to cross the Black Sea in a hot air balloon; he wants to get to the capitalist federation so that he can improve his invention\u2014the first nuclear reactor. The travelers manage to cross the border and fly to Italy, where they land and are arrested by the local police. Later, Zhuravlyov and his boyfriend manage to escape from the police and hide underground with local communists. At the same time, an intelligence group of agents of the capitalist federation infiltrates Moscow, steals Zhuravlyov\u2019s nuclear reactor, and uses it to destroy the building of the former British embassy, at the same time kidnapping a young Komsomol girl, Lyudmila Chudnovska. Lyudmila manages to escape, get the necessary materials for Zhuravlyov, and even prevent the execution of the leader of the pro-communist rebellion in Madagascar. Zhuravlyov, having stolen inventions from the capitalists, manages to complete his apparatus, with the help of which he destroys most of the military equipment and weapons of the capitalist federation, as well as the seat of the world capitalist government. After that, with the help of Italian and New Zealand communists, Zhuravlyov returns to Moscow, where he speaks to a wide audience with a detailed description of his invention and the prospects for a future communist economy. After the destruction of the military equipment and the headquarters of the world capitalist government, a workers\u2019 uprising begins in the capitalist countries. The novel ends with the common singing of \u201cThe Internationale.\u201d</p> <p>As can be seen from the plot of this novel, the Ukrainian writer dreamed that Russian communists would destroy Western liberal-democratic society with the help of nuclear weapons stolen from it and then establish a world communist dictatorship centered in Moscow. It seems that Moscow\u2019s wishes have not changed over the past hundred years.</p> <p>In general, it is worth noting that the 1920s were a time of illusory fascination with the communist utopia. It seemed to the authors of fantastic works that machines plus communism (or, as leader of the Russian communists Vladimir Lenin said, \u201csocialism plus electrification of the whole country\u201d) would immediately lead to the goal of positivism. To this end, it was proposed to concentrate all efforts on industrial production, to push all theology out of life, and to leave from metaphysics only Marxism-Leninism. Some ten years later, such a view led Ukraine to the first catastrophe in the confrontation with Russian imperialism, which arranged the Holodomor and eliminated the Ukrainian intellectuals. This was the Ukrainian \u201croaring twenties\u201d; these times literally roared with engines, factories, and plants. It is no coincidence that Volodymyr Vynnychenko\u2019s SF novel, published in 1924, was called Solar Machine (Vynnychenko 1928).</p> <p>Vynnychenko was in opposition to the government of Ukraine, which was later captured by the Russian communists. For a short period in 1918, he headed the government of the Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic, but Vynnychenko quickly quarreled with opponents of the conservative political camp because he was a committed socialist. As soon as the Russian\u2013Ukrainian war began in 1918, he left politics and emigrated to Austria, where he wrote his memoirs and his SF novel. The oppositionist and emigrant Solar Machine was an unheard-of success among readers and had three reprints in Soviet Ukraine from 1928 to 1930. But after 1930, the elimination of Ukrainian national deviations began and Vynnychenko was banned.</p> <p>In Solar Machine, princess Elise agrees to marry capitalist tycoon Mertens in order to later avenge the death of her bankrupt father. The far-left INVARAC (International Vanguard of Revolutionary Action) is gathering at the tycoon\u2019s estate, to which Elisa swears allegiance in order to take revenge on Mertens.</p> <p>Inventor Rudolf Stor is convinced that man is burdened by the need for food, and that he would become truly free if he were fed directly by the sun\u2019s rays. In search of a way to do this, he discovered the \u201csolar mineral\u201d helionite, which is capable of turning any organic matter into a nutrient under the influence of light\u2014\u201csolar bread.\u201d With the help of the mineral, he builds a \u201csolar machine\u201d in which it is enough to put grass or leaves in, sprinkle with sweat, and let the sunlight through, to get free food.</p> <p>INVARAC is interested in the \u201csolar machine.\u201d The organization spreads the invention around the world, thereby liberating people from the oppression of capitalists. People no longer need to work for a piece of bread, so factory workers are leaving their jobs. In addition, \u201csolar bread\u201d causes a feeling of euphoria. At first, it seems like a good thing, but soon civilization itself collapses\u2014power plants stop working without workers; water pipes and communications fail. People begin to fight for the remnants of the property of their exploiters and against those who do not accept \u201csolar bread.\u201d Mertens prepares to clear Berlin of rebels, while enemies are advancing on Germany. Seeing the collapse of all hopes for the further development of humanity, with people reduced to an animal state, Stor gathers the Free Union of Creative Work, which restores the life of the cities. After winter, the desire for work awakens in people, but it is now voluntary, and not forced.</p> <p>As can be seen from the text of the novel, Vynnychenko was also caught up in the modern illusions of technocratic positivism. It seemed to him that technological inventions would lead to a revolution and the victory of the ideas of socialism. The communist occupation of Ukraine and Moscow\u2019s political terror taught him nothing.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-one/#the-1930s-hard-fiction-and-futurism","title":"The 1930s: Hard Fiction and Futurism","text":"The 1930s saw the start of hard fiction and futurism. <p>The 1930s saw the start of hard fiction and futurism. These were characterized by the fact that the former fascination with positivist machinery began to be felt as an anachronism and turned from a goal, an id\u00e9e fixe, into a beautiful decoration. A fantasy novel from the 1930s was transformed from an intrusive piece of communist propaganda into something that had a quintessential text of liberal pop-culture as a sample to follow.</p> <p>One of the most striking examples of this is Yuri Smolych\u2019s trilogy Beautiful Disasters (Smolych [1929\u201334] 1965). It depicts the mad Romanian scientist Dr. Galvanescu, who uses surgical operations to transform people into robots. This plot clearly imitates The Island of Dr. Moreau by Herbert Wells. Smolych does not suggest outright communist propaganda and does not call for a world revolution controlled from Moscow. He simply writes an exciting adventure novel in a \u201cwestern style.\u201d The ideological confrontation in it is more like a domestic quarrel. When Komsomol member and pretty girl Yulia Sakhno tries to find out about the doctor\u2019s experiments, she talks to his employee. He is afraid.</p> <p>Yuri Smolych trilogy Beautiful Disasters</p> <p>\"Shut up.

After that I have to go home\u2026\"</p> <p>\"So you are\u2026 a Soviet citizen?\"</p> <p>The stranger backed away from the window and slammed the frame with a curse.</p> <p>Sakhno could still hear how he huddled near the pinhole, cursing himself and the Soviet government. Stunned and confused, Sakhno stood under the window, not knowing what to do. She would have stood there for a long time, but the window opened once more and the head of the indignant stranger stuck out for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of here, you bloody communist bitch, I\u2019ll call Dr. Galvanescu immediately!\u201d (Smolych [1929\u201334] 1965, 54)</p> <p>Pavlo Beilin, author of the afterword to Smolych\u2019s novels, writes that \u201cthe main idea of the book is not to prove that the collapse of the ideas of bourgeois society is beneficial to us. The writer, comparing bourgeois and Soviet medicine, wanted to reveal the misanthropic essence of bourgeois ideology and the humanity and progressiveness of Soviet and socialist science\u201d (Smolych [1929\u201334] 1965, 223).</p> <p>So, in ten years, the desire to seize capitalist countries and forcibly introduce Russian communism there turned into banal envy. Smolych himself was a devoted communist; for many years he cooperated with the Soviet secret police and wrote reports on his colleagues\u2014writers and film directors. These denunciations were so detailed and refined that the history of Ukrainian literature can be studied by them.</p> <p>Volodymyr Vladko is also a prominent figure in this direction. He created several truly noticeable novels. For example, The Argonauts of the Universe (Vladko 1935) was published several times in Japan and Croatia. It also was the first work in Ukrainian literature about flight into space. Interestingly, two Russians and one Chinese go on a space trip to Venus, and a Ukrainian, a student of the Polytechnic Institute, Galina Ryzhko, sneaks on board illegally. In the first editions of the novel, instead of the girl-student there was a boy-student Vasyl Ryzhko, but the author received 1500 letters from readers with various tips and realized that the girl would be much better to save from the attacks of the Venus monsters because it would look very sexy. According to the genre, it is a typical novel of hard SF that any American author could have written. Of the Soviet features, it only has a flag of the USSR, which the heroes set on Venus. Interestingly, the author rewrote his novel many times, in each edition changing some essential details there to adjust his text to the requirements of the time. For example, in the versions of the 1950s, Vladko wrote about the leading science of the countries of the socialist camp\u2014Hungary, Bulgaria, and the German Democratic Republic. Of course, in 1935, when the first edition of this novel was published, the mentioned countries were still bourgeois, and Vladko could not write about the leading science in these countries, so as not to have conflicts with communists carrying out surveillance of the literature.</p> <p>Fiction writers of the so-called socialist camp, which was the zone of military-political influence of the mutation of the former Russian Empire\u2014the USSR\u2014perfectly understood the power of the influence of communist propaganda through the works of SF and exploited this power in every way, until some of them realized its perniciousness. One of the first of such writers was Stanislaw Lem. Lem banned the translation of his first novel, The Magellanic Cloud, into Japanese, citing the following reasoning: \u201cJapan has never known a communist regime, and if my novel inclines even one Japanese person to communism, I will burn in hell\u201d (Lem 2005, 12).</p> <p>Unfortunately, most Ukrainian Soviet fiction writers who survived the collapse of the USSR remained loyal communists and even Russian imperialists. They did not see in this any danger for their country, and, as we see now, they miscalculated cruelly.</p> <p>Another novel by Volodymyr Vladko, Aero-torpedos Turn Back (Vladko 1934), is much more ideologized. It refers to the war of drones between the capitalist countries and the USSR. According to the plot of the novel, \u201cinterested states,\u201d the Great Saksia, Swabia, and Osteria, make a number of claims to the USSR. The conflict in a few days became the basis for the closure of communist newspapers in \u201cinterested states\u201d; the press published calls for war with the USSR. The concept of capitalists is that the blow to Moscow should be made by radio-controlled drones\u2014aero-torpedos. But the tactics of the lightning attack did not work, as the Soviet Union also prepared for war and had its high-tech developments. Meanwhile, a Yellow Empire\u2014Japan or China\u2014attacks from the East. Capitalists decide to use bacteriological weapons and infect the Soviet communists with the flu virus. The flu epidemic is striking Moscow, Smolensk, and other regions of Russia. But, in the end, capitalist engineers are aware of the injustice of this war and surrender to the Soviet Army. In the capitalist countries, uprisings begin, and they become communist. At the end, everyone is happy to celebrate the victory of Russian weapons and communist ideology over the insidious world of capitalism.</p> <p>This book is impressive as it places the author\u2019s childlike naiv\u00e9t\u00e9 alongside the literal prediction of events that would soon happen. It is also worth mentioning Vladko\u2019s novel Iron Rebellion\u2014in the first version The Robotari Are Going. This first Ukrainian novel about robots was published in 1929 (Valdko [1929] 2017), just nine years after R.U.R. by Karel \u010capek (\u010capek [1928] 2020). Of course, this book is an undisguised call for the overthrow of the state system in countries outside the USSR and the establishment of a communist dictatorship in them, with the governing center in Moscow. It was planned to do this with the help of advanced technologies.</p> <p>The events of the novel take place in some capitalist country with a hint of the USA. Jonathan Houston is the owner of the machine-building factories that have stopped working\u2014the workers have announced a multi-day strike and are demanding higher wages. There is a rumor that Houston\u2019s company intends to replace live workers with wirelessly powered cybernetic robots. Houston assures that the robots only obey him and do not demand a salary or rest, so soon all workers will be replaced and this will mean the victory of capitalism over socialism.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Houston\u2019s stock is skyrocketing, and robots are cheaper to maintain than live workers. The leader of the ultra-right militants, Thomas Beers, sends the strikebreakers to the committee of strikers and demands that the strike be stopped in the morning. The committee dissolves itself, but does not give up the struggle. A rally is being held on the square near the plant, against which armored personnel carriers and soldiers who start shooting are brought out. Under the command of the leader of the strikers, Bob Leisley, they manage to de-energize the city and seize weapons with which to fight back. But the city is surrounded by an even bigger army. Houston offers Beers any amount of money if only his factories are saved. He manages to turn on the power and leads the robots into battle. But in a few minutes, the inventor of the robots, Engineer Jefferson, sends a signal that intercepts control. The strikebreakers turn on Houston with Beers and stomp them down. The communist revolution breaks out in the city.</p> <p>The Soviet authorities liked Volodymyr Vladko so much that he was even appointed head of the Main Repertoire Committee of the Ukrainian SSR (the main Ukrainian censor). However, he did not last long in this position. Once he wrote a critical article for the newspaper Soviet Art, where he praised the operetta Love of an Actress, which was based on Maupassant\u2019s story Boule de Suif, staged in Lviv. But other censors did not like the performance; they decided that it did not call for a communist revolution but only distracted the audience from it. The play was removed from the repertoire, and then a devastating article called \u201cA Serious Lesson\u201d appeared in the newspaper Lviv Truth. They wrote that the theater did not use \u201cthe great opportunity to turn to the Soviet theme, to show the wonderful today\u2019s revived Lviv region, the patriotic deeds of Lviv residents \u2013 Stakhanovites of factories and fields.\u201d Instead, \u201cvulgar, vapid vaudeville\u201d was created. Volodymyr Vladko was fired from his job after this story (Lvovska Pravda 1953).</p> <p>The tragic fate of the writer Dmytro Buzko is very telling: he was a staunch Stalinist, but he died because he publicly expressed doubts about Stalin\u2019s infallibility. He was immediately fired, arrested, and shot. Buzko wrote the fantastic novel Crystal Paradise (1935) two years before his murder by the Stalinists (Buzko [1935] 1959). According to the plot of the novel, a brilliant scientist-chemist from fascist Germany, Fritz Gruber, invents a recipe for super-strong glass, which can be used in many industries and the national economy. Due to the non-recognition of the genius in his homeland and the intrigues of the powerful bourgeoisie, the genius has to emigrate to the Soviet Union. Thanks to his invention, a utopian state is being formed in the USSR. From an artistic point of view, the novel is typical of the Soviet \u201cproduction\u201d fiction of the 1920s and 1930s. The characters are revealed superficially, represented by peculiar social labels. One of them is a \u201cbig bourgeois,\u201d another is a \u201clittle bourgeois,\u201d and the third is a \u201cromantic scientist.\u201d Nothing is known about the inner world of the heroes. The plot is described schematically. The actions and dialogues of the heroes are often contrived and implausible. There is a lot of Stalinist propaganda in the novel. It is characteristic that tanks and fighter planes were the first to be manufactured from miracle glass on an industrial scale.</p> <p>But not all Ukrainian writers of the 1930s gave their talent to fight for the victory of Russian communism. Unfortunately, the fate of those who avoided it was sad. Ukrainian writer Geo Shkurupii became the first Ukrainian writer who specialized in fantastic works within the framework of futurism. He did not write a single novel that could be called SF. There are only some fantastic episodes in his book Doors in a Day (Shkurupii 1931). In general, this novel is written in a bright, expressionist manner; stylistically, it is very diverse and intricate. It could rightly be called the Ukrainian Ulysses were it not for its very modest volume\u2014the book has a little more than 200 pages.</p> <p>Although Shkurupii was a communist, he was not as devoted a communist as, for example, Vladko. There was a lot of truth about the real world in his works, which the communist supervisors could not forgive him. That is why the writer was arrested on December 3, 1934 on charges of belonging to the \u201cKyiv terrorist organization UUN\u201d (Union of Ukrainian Nationalists). In 1937, he was executed, and his family was deprived of housing and evicted from Kyiv, as a family of \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d After twenty years, Shkurupii was rehabilitated and acquitted due to the absence of a crime. Of course, there was no question of any compensation from the state.</p> <p>Those who study Ukrainian literature of the Soviet period of the 1920s\u20131990s may wonder why it looks the way it does, why the writers were so focused on political propaganda and so persistently promoted the idea of a communist revolution and the expansion of Moscow\u2019s control over Europe.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-one/#the-1940s-and-1950s-short-sighted-fiction","title":"The 1940s and 1950s: Short-Sighted Fiction","text":"Why was fiction short-sighted? <p>Throughout the 1930s, a methodical elimination of nationally conscious intellectuals took place in Ukraine; after its completion, a command came from Moscow to begin the fight against so-called Ukrainian nationalism. In these times, any manifestation of Ukrainian consciousness had become dangerous. Literature ultimately turned into service of party communist propaganda, and even fiction had to convincingly prove how exactly the Soviet people would soon implement the wild fantasies that were announced at each successive communist party congress. This genre was later called \u201cshort-sighted fiction.\u201d</p> <p>A vivid example of this genre is Mykola Trublaini\u2019s novel The Deep Path (written in 1941 but published seven years later, Trublaini [1948] 2020). There are no amazing and extraordinary events in the book; all its fiction is purely utilitarian. Soviet citizens are building a deep tunnel between Moscow and the Far East for high-speed train traffic, which was of exceptional strategic importance in case of war. However, it is worth noting the peculiarity of Trublaini\u2019s authorial manner, which allowed him to remain in the history of Ukrainian literature: his romantic heroes fall in love, dream, drink champagne, and are sure that a strong desire will allow them to defeat nature. Children liked Trublaini\u2019s works; there is even a prize named after him in Ukraine.</p> <p>Lyrical poet, polyglot, and soldier of the Ukrainian Galician Army (this is the armed force of the Western Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic, the state that existed in 1918\u201320), Myroslav Kapii became famous for translating six novels by Jules Verne into Ukrainian. Although Kapii was a radical anti-communist, he hated the USSR, but he can also be included in the stream of \u201cshort-sighted fiction\u201d because the author\u2019s main task was to predict in detail the technical and social innovations that would appear in the near future. Kapii\u2019s novel The Land of Blue Orchids (1932) envisions Ukraine in the twenty-first century in great detail. Interestingly, most of the author\u2019s predictions came true. The territory of Ukraine, as Kapii saw it in 1932, coincides with the territory of modern Ukraine: the coat of arms is the trident of Prince Volodymyr, the currency is the hryvnia, the system is democratic presidential-parliamentary, and the name of the parliament is Verkhovna Rada. In addition, Kapii used the word \u201ctelevision\u201d in the novel and predicted Skype communication and the existence of an automobile factory in the city of Kremenchuk. According to the plot, the first manned ship of mankind, the Queen of Virginia, goes to Mars, but disappears. A year later, an employee of the Ukrainian observatory, Ihor Kharitonenko, during his observations, discovers an unknown body in space approaching the Earth. It turns out that it is the Queen of Virginia. The ship lands near Kyiv in Boryspil, where the international airport is now located. But it was not Americans who arrived on the ship; rather, they were Martians genetically related to Ukrainians.</p> <p>In Vasyl Berezhny\u2019s novel To the Starry Worlds (1956), the first Soviet space expedition is sent to study the Moon. The purpose is to find minerals that can be used for the needs of mankind. A rocket with American astronauts lands on the Moon secretly from the Soviet cosmonauts. The novel, as one might expect, is full of Soviet propaganda. Before the flight, the head of the Government Committee for the Organization of the Earth-Moon Flight says in his speech: \u201cWe want to make the Moon an outpost of advanced science, not a military base, as the imperialist tycoons are planning!\u201d (Berezhny 1956, 34). The whole exciting trip to the Moon turned out to be just a convenient backdrop for casually feeding the reader communist propaganda.</p> <p>The book contains many disputes between American and Soviet astronauts, such as:</p> <p>Vasyl Berezhny To the Starry Worlds (1956)</p> <p>American astronaut: \u201cThe essence of life is not to create material values. The point is to use these material values! Don\u2019t deny it: I know what you\u2019re going to say. \u2018Exploitation of man by man! Extortion\u2019 and other similar loud words. But if you seriously thought about the history of mankind, you would see that all of it is a struggle for the redistribution of material goods. Take all the rebellions, revolutions and wars since the Roman Empire. Didn\u2019t the slaves rebel to seize wealth? And the French Revolution, did it have other ideals? And what does your communist bible say?\u2014\u2018The proletariat has nothing to lose, but it can acquire everything.\u2019 Acquire!\u201d</p> <p>Soviet cosmonaut: \u201cYou, as I see it, are a theorist! It\u2019s just a pity that your \u2018philosophy\u2019 is wolfish. Homo homini lupus est is your credo. And how can you understand Marxism and the ideals of the socialist revolution, which does not replace one exploiter with another, but destroys all exploitation!\u201d</p> <p>American astronaut: \u201cAh, what do you communists say, it is better to be rich than poor! Patricians, plebeians, and slaves all died, but the patricians ate from silver and gold dishes and bathed in marble pools, while the plebeians and slaves bent under the heavy burden of life\u201d (Berezhny 1956, 46).</p> <p>The fate of the writer Mykola Dashkiev vividly testifies to why the works of old Ukrainian fiction writers seem so down-to-earth, such timid, \u201cshort-sighted fiction.\u201d To explain the conditions in which the writers of that time worked, one eloquent fact can be cited: the building \u201cSlovo\u201d (The Word), where the young writer Dashkiev was given a room in 1948, in those days in Kharkiv was called HPD (House of Pretrial Detention) because many of its residents in the Stalinist times disappeared behind bars and were executed. This led to unprecedented restrictions. While preparing his novel The Celebration of Life (1952) for publication, Dashkiev had to attach to the manuscript a certificate from a leading expert in the field of biology confirming that the scientific plot of the work was quite possible.</p> <p>The novel Dragon\u2019s Teeth (Dashkiev 1957) tells about the struggle of Soviet and Indian biological scientists with English spies for the right to possess the secrets of \u201cFood of the Gods\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Teeth\u201d\u2014unique biological catalysts, with the help of which it would be possible to solve the primordial problem of hunger throughout the world or perform unique organ transplant operations.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-one/#the-1960s-sixtiers-and-hippie-cosmist-oles-berdnyk","title":"The 1960s: Sixtiers and Hippie-Cosmist Oles Berdnyk","text":"In the 1960s, a political thaw began. <p>The USSR liberalized.

The sixtiers were liberal communists. This, among other things, was manifested in the fact that they, for the first time, abandoned the idea of positivism in its Soviet sense, that is, the idea that scientific progress would help the USSR to quickly establish communism throughout the Earth. Instead, the sixtiers turned to religious mysticism and naive utopianism.</p> <p>Oles Berdnyk, one of the main Ukrainian sixtiers, a writer, was also called a \u201chippie-cosmist.\u201d He was a theoretician and founder of the Ukrainian Spiritual Republic (USR); he believed that a nation is not a random combination of relatives and families but a powerful collective spirit that has its own unique purpose in the evolution of the universe. He saw no division into believers and non-believers; for him, the presence of the spiritual unity of Ukrainians made it possible to eliminate political parties, and ideological and confessional contradictions. If Ukraine chose the path of harmonization, spiritualization of all spheres of life, and consolidation of the forces of culture, science, and spirituality, then other nations would follow, and the Brotherhood of the Spiritual Republics of the Earth would be formed. The USR held congresses that were essentially mystical happenings.</p> <p>Berdnyk served five years behind bars for saying at a theater meeting in 1949 that \u201cStalin may be a genius for some, but a fool for others.\u201d He was sentenced to ten years for alleged treason, but after five years he was pardoned after repentance, which was strange (in the 1930s, he would have been immediately shot for these words). As mentioned, a political thaw was approaching. Liberalization had reached the point where Berdnyk was accepted into the Union of Writers of Ukraine two years after his release from prison. It is worth knowing that the Union of Writers of Ukraine was a special organization where writers verified by communists and the politically loyal were engaged in propaganda in the form of literature. Throughout his life, Berdnyk wrote about twenty novels that were far from communist propaganda. He was also one of the founders of the human rights-focused Ukrainian Helsinki Group. For his activities in this group, Berdnyk was imprisoned again for five years in 1979. But the USSR had already begun to collapse, and Berdnyk repented again, saying that he was ordered to create the Ukrainian Helsinki Group by the US Central Intelligence Agency.</p> <p>Berdnyk\u2019s novel The Star Corsair was written in the 1960s (Berdnyk 1971) and became a real bestseller of those times. It was translated into twenty-six languages, although it caused many scandals. The main reason for this was the unheard-of mystical Ukrainian nationalism of the author, which caused misunderstanding among the surrounding Soviet people. For example, Berdnyk wrote about the fact that in 2082, before the flight, the cosmonauts climbed to the top of the highest mountain in Ukraine, Hoverla, where they saw decorations in the traditions of Ukrainian folklore. Berdnyk\u2019s nationalism was so amazing that it caused a shock reaction. After the publication of the novel, the author was expelled from the Writers\u2019 Union of Ukraine.</p> <p>According to the plot of the novel, a young scientist, Serhiy Gorenytsia, wants to invent a time machine. While thinking, he sees the image of a Cossack-Charakternik (a warrior of the ancient Ukrainian state who possessed magical abilities). The Charakternik possessed the Black Gramota\u2014a magical manuscript that allowed changing the flow of time. With the help of hypnosis, the scientist enters the consciousness of the Cossack-magician and learns that the Black Gramota was extracted from the grave of Alexander the Great and buried in Mount Divich. The scientist conducts excavations, extracts the Black Gramota, and, with its help, establishes contact with the Black Papyrus\u2014a mystical being who tells the scientist that the collapse of positivism, with which this article about SF began, has taken place, that is, no technological inventions and scientific discoveries will bring positive results. Instead, the Black Papyrus offers a mystical solution: knowing the world through love and mutual understanding. It\u2019s just a set of words that don\u2019t mean anything, but that\u2019s how mysticism works.</p> <p>The Black Papyrus shows the scientist a story about the journey of the Ukrainian spacecraft Lyubov to another star system. During the trip, all crew members die from radiation; only two children, who are being raised by a robot, survive. The children become adults and arrive on another planet, where they come into contact with high-tech intelligent flowers. After this, the travelers fly to another planet, where they find a civilization destroyed by positivism: technological advances have finally led to the degradation of civilization from excessive hedonism. On the whole planet, there is only one woman, Iswari, who has kept her common sense. She asks the boys to take her with them to Earth and falls in love with a robot on the way. The robot also loves the alien woman but cannot have sex with her. To overcome this obstacle, the robot creates a body for himself from the remains of the astronauts who died from radiation.</p> <p>After hearing the story of the Black Papyrus, the scientist is convinced that positivism is really a dead end. Berdnyk offers an alternative to scientific and technical progress in the second part of the novel. One of his characters, an inmate in a psychiatric hospital, Aeras, claims to have attained a level of cosmic consciousness that allows him to go outside his body, levitate, and pass through walls. Together with his accomplices, Aeras escapes to the Asteroid of Freedom, where he finds a colony of dissidents who oppose the society of positivism. The positivists want to destroy the colonists, but they go to another dimension that is inaccessible to logic and physics.</p> <p>At the end of the novel, the scientist learns that he is actually the leader of the Horikorin group of cosmocrats from the plane of Ara, and his main goal is to unite the people of Earth and the thinking beings of the noosphere.</p> <p>Through this story, the repression against the dissidents, whom the Soviet authorities sent to psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s, as well as the desire of these dissidents to get out of the power of the communist positivists from Moscow, can be seen quite clearly. Berdnyk\u2019s revolutionary mysticism was a kind of protest against Soviet totalitarianism and formed a certain pair with it: time has shown that they cannot exist without each other. As a hypothetical idea for the 1960s, it sounded interesting, but in practice, going beyond the limits of the body and reaching the level of cosmic consciousness turned out to be absolutely impossible, so the impressive body of Berdnyk\u2019s work remained in its time. From the standpoint of today, it looks like a vivid dissident happening, but nothing more. It never became an alternative to positivism.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-one/#references","title":"References","text":"My Sources <ul> <li>Berdnyk, Oles. The Star Corsair.

In the 1980s, a national revival began, and SF developed greater local markets and themes. The economic crisis of the 1990s nearly destroyed SF literature in Ukraine.

At that time, society lost faith in the victory of communist positivism; all residents of the USSR chose pragmatism as their model and tried to obtain the best possible living conditions amid the destruction of the socialist economy. </p> <p>Pragmatism in Ukraine, among other things, was manifested in the fact that writers often chose the Russian language for writing and publishing their works. In this way, they could obtain a wider market and a larger circulation, because the Russian language was known in all the countries that made up the USSR. It was a kind of conformism: writers no longer risked their lives for political statements; rather, they chose the path of least resistance for a successful career.</p> <p>The path of the writer, Boris Shtern, is very revealing here. He sent his story to the Russian writer, Boris Strugatskyi, for positive feedback from him. With this feedback, he turned to the Russian magazine, Chemistry and Life, which had begun to publish science fiction (SF) in the 1970s. </p> <p>Publication in this magazine, the circulation of which reached 150,000 copies, practically guaranteed the rapid publication of books and mass popularity among readers. The same applied to the content of the work. To receive widespread popularity, it was necessary to avoid local Ukrainian topics and mainly write about what was happening in Russia. </p> <p>In this way, the impression was created that everything important and worthy of attention happened in Russia; Ukraine, as a colonized provincial territory on the outskirts of the empire, was mentioned only condescendingly and with demeaning humor. </p> <p>The hero of Shtern\u2019s novel, Notes of a Dinosaur, recalls that he literally fled from Ukraine to Russia because, in his opinion, Ukraine was a country of swindlers and petty thieves, and it would be impossible to make a career there (Shtern 2002, p. 7). </p> <p>This attitude was also quite noticeable in Shtern\u2019s short humorous play, Zmiiny Island, The Fleet Will Not Let You Down! (Shtern 1996). This work depicts a group of admirals from different countries of the world who would like to capture this Ukrainian island. Each admiral receives a set of vividly chauvinistic characteristics built on Russian stereotypes. </p> <p>Since this text was written in 1992, a special postmodern humor is noticeable in it. It is impossible to say for sure whether its author is truly a Russian chauvinist or whether he is simply playing the role of a chauvinist, keeping a certain distance from this image.</p> <p>The history of Zmiiny Island is also noteworthy. Thirty years after the publication of Shtern\u2019s play, the Russian\u2013Ukrainian war began, with hostilities taking place on the Ukrainian island of Zmiiny. Ultimately, Ukraine managed to regain control over the island after it had been captured by Russia.</p> <p>If we look for analogies with other literature, the postmodern irony and humor of Boris Shtern are very close to those of Stanislaw Lem. This is especially true of the series of stories about Inspector Bel Amor, which resembles Lem\u2019s series about the pilot Pirx.</p> <p>Similar to Boris Shtern\u2019s fate was that of the very talented Ukrainian writer Volodymyr Savchenko. He was born in Ukraine, but left to study and pursue a career in Moscow before returning to Ukraine, where he worked at the Institute of Cybernetics. Savchenko wrote all his works in Russian, called himself a Russian writer, and defiantly left the Union of Writers of Ukraine. </p> <p>In 2002, in an interview with the writer Yana Dubynyanska, Savchenko spoke of his feelings about the collapse of the USSR:</p> <p>It turned out that I am a very Soviet person. Although I was never a member of the communist party, I was close to illegal publishing and dissidents. But when I saw the results of the collapse of the USSR, I was somewhat despaired. I left the Writers\u2019 Union of Ukraine back in 1993 and I still don\u2019t miss them. An SF writer cannot write if he does not believe in the future. And it happened that I stopped believing. (cited in Dubynyanska 2002)</p> <p>In the same interview, Savchenko quite clearly formulated the main creed of cyberpunk, which the author calls the \u201ccollapse of positivism\u201d:</p> <p>The very fact that a person does not become better from the development of technology and service proves that something is wrong here (cited in Dubynyanska 2002)</p> <p>The Russian writer Ilf, in his notebooks of the late 1920s, made an interesting point:</p> <p>Earlier in science fiction, radio was the main thing. People expected happiness for mankind from the radio (Ilf 2021, 123). Now we have a radio, but we have no happiness. Since then, as soon as aviation and spaceships appeared, and laser and nuclear power, there was no general happiness, and there is none. Civilization does not work for man (Dubynyanska 2002)</p> <p>Savchenko\u2019s novel Self-Discovery (1967) tells the story of Ukrainian graduate student Kryvoshein, who synthesized his own clone with extraordinary body capabilities with the help of a computer with artificial intelligence. </p> <p>After talking with his own clone, Kryvoshein-1 decides not to reveal what happened but to send clone Kryvoshein-2 to work at a university in Moscow. Meanwhile, the original Kryvoshein-1 makes his next clone, Kryvoshein-3, who turns out to be a psychopath and tries to kill Kryvoshein-1. Kryvoshein-1 decides to send Kryvoshein-3 to a remote region of Russia, and he himself begins to produce the next, even more perfect clones.</p> <p>During the experiment, Kryvoshein-1 decides to update his own body with the help of a clone synthesizer, but he dies. As a result, many copies of Kryvoshein-1 remain, but the original itself is now missing.</p> <p>In the philosophy of postmodernism, a copy without an original is called a simulacrum:</p> <p>\u201cThe simulacrum is never that what hides the truth\u2014it is truth that hides the fact that there is none. The simulacrum is true\u201d (Baudrillard 1994, 1)</p> <p>It is a key postmodernist term. However, Jean Baudrillard wrote his treatise, Simulacra and Simulation (Baudrillard 1994) in 1981\u2014twenty-four years after the publication of Savchenko\u2019s novel.</p> <p>The example of this book shows how the construction and the subject matter of Ukrainian SF became more complicated in the 1970s. The authors no longer sought to serve the Communist Party or to implement a propagandist directive, or even to escape from reality into \u201cmystical abracadabra,\u201d as Oles Berdnyk did in the 1960s. Now the books solved the fundamental problems of human existence, which would soon be of interest to European philosophical thought.</p> <p>It is interesting that Savchenko\u2019s novel, written in Russian, was translated into eleven languages in twelve countries, including in the USA in 1979 in the Best of Soviet Science Fiction series, but there is still no Ukrainian translation.</p> <p>The 1970s and the 1980s in Ukrainian SF had a lot in common, not only because of the cynicism and conformism of the Soviet people but also because of the spread of the postmodern paradigm of thinking, which was consistent with conformism. </p> <p>If all models and samples are conditionally equivalent, as postmodernism claims, what is the point of victorious exploits for the benefit of the Communist Party? The postmodern model contributed to the avoidance of heroic pathos in literature; preference was given instead to refined logical exercises and literary games. </p> <p>One of the bright representatives of this style was Volodymyr Zayets. A doctor by education, he devoted his stories to paradoxical phenomena of the psyche and the philosophical problems of perception of reality. An excerpt from his story Temponauts follows:</p> <p>He believed and knew that the past, present, and future exist on the same space\u2013time axis. One thing worried him the most: To what extent is the future determined by the past? Should human will be taken into account, or is this will only apparent and subject to the same objective laws to which all nature, including living things, is subject? When that is the case, there is only one real future. When it is not, the outlines of the future are blurred; there are somehow incomprehensibly several equal and probabilistic realities in it. (Zayets 1986, 17)</p> <p>The writer\u2019s stories are distinguished by an unexpected course of plots and often sharp humor. A sudden twist appears in the last lines of each story that changes the meaning of the entire text. Zayets\u2019 works are most reminiscent of the stories full of humor and paradox by American writer Robert Sheckley.</p> <p>The Kharkiv writer Yevhen Filimonov wrote many stories that are difficult to call SF in the usual sense, although all the signs of this genre exist. For example, in The Ophthalmologist (Filimonov 1988, 212) a doctor in some strange way corrects the vision of a healthy patient during an examination, so that this man begins to see the world differently: he has good taste and interest in art, and the banality and vulgarity that he used to like suddenly disgust him. </p> <p>In another story, The Music Box, a rude worker asks a doctor to rid him of the memories of classical music melodies that are annoyingly ringing in his head. After this operation, he feels a painful emptiness and decides to heal himself by listening to more classical music.</p> <p>In a third story, On the Road, a mother tries to explain to her little daughter that they have been racing through space for many years to reach a distant star because their own star exploded. But there is no certainty that the planets of another star are suitable for life. Therefore, wouldn\u2019t it be better to stop, to not spend energy on speed but spend it on more acceptable living conditions on a starship?</p> <p>Filimonov was interested in complex and ambiguous topics. There are no instructions, recipes, or propaganda in any of his stories; he only suggests thinking about which of the proposed lifestyles is better.</p> <p>However, even at the end of the 1970s, when most Ukrainian writers had lost faith in utopian political theories forever, some authors remained who seemed to still be living in the 1950s. For example, Anatoly Dimarov\u2019s fantastic novel, The Second Planet ([1980] 2017) depicts the terraforming of Venus in the twenty-fifth century, which led to the development of fascism.</p> <p>Earthlings manage to significantly improve the climate of this hot planet with extraordinary pressure, but they still cannot live on it, so two new races are artificially bred specifically for the population of Venus: Venusians and Orangs. The first group are only an improved physical modification of people, while the second are significantly behind in development, resembling orangutans.</p> <p>The Orangs develop an underground totalitarian civilization, copying the German Nazism of the 1930s and 1940s. A delegation of Ukrainians goes to the planet to study the sociological and cultural consequences of the existence of the Orangs. In the depths of Venus, they find a city, and in the square there is a statue of an Orang with small antennae and the label \u201cAdolf Hitler.\u201d All the Orangs shout \u201cHeil\u201d to each other when they meet, and march in columns. It is a militarized state led by the monarch Orang the Third, and it is based on the works of Hitler and Nietzsche.</p> <p>The main goal of the Orangs is to dominate Venus and exterminate the Venusian race. The language is human, only in reversed letters, so \u201cwater\u201d becomes \u201cretaw\u201d; only the words \u201cAdolf Hitler\u201d and \u201cheil\u201d remain unchanged.</p> <p>The Earthlings are captured by the Orangs and have to create new creatures to fight the Venusians, but eventually they manage to escape and inform everyone about the danger of the Orangs.</p> <p>The novel ends like this:</p> <p>Venus-Earth spacecraft launched in a month. During this time, great changes took place on Venus: the Orang state disappeared. The Venusians argued for a long time about what to do with the Orangs; there were even voices to declare war and destroy them to the ground, but the majority insisted otherwise. As all the Orangs are sick, they should not be killed, but treated. The reason for their degeneration was also confirmed. The artificial gene of intelligence, which put the Orangs on the same level as humans, turned out to be unstable, and the Orangs awakened animalistic tendencies. Huge hospitals were hastily built, and then armadas of helicopters took to the air with balloons filled with gas. This gas did not kill, but only put you to sleep.</p> <p>So the Orangs were neutralized and gradually transported to the hospital, where a whole army of doctors was waiting for them. (Dimarov [1980] 2017, 85)</p> <p>This whole story is shockingly reminiscent of modern Russian propaganda, which claims that allegedly Ukrainians have fallen ill with fascism and should be treated for it. Dimarov claims that fascism is the result of a genetic error, so it can be corrected by means of modern medicine. Such a practice was common in the USSR, where dissidents were treated with the help of punitive psychiatry.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#the-1980s-reconstruction-and-national-revival","title":"The 1980s: Reconstruction and National Revival","text":"<p>In the 1980s, the futility of the existence of the USSR finally became clear, and its collapse became only a matter of time. All spheres of life in Ukraine were rapidly liberalized; Ukrainian writers who wrote in Russian decided to switch to Ukrainian in order to support the national culture. These were rather short times of national romanticism, when it seemed that independence from the USSR would solve all problems by its very fact. Such an exalted state also affected science fiction (SF). Many new authors appeared, and experienced authors published new books, some of which became iconic.</p> <p>Natalie Haydamaka\u2019s story \u201cOnly Three Steps\u201d (Haydamaka 1990) is about existential choice. A woman sees a boy in the road who is about to be hit by a truck and she rushes to save him, but suddenly some unknown creatures stop the flow of time. They inform the woman that in three steps she will save the boy but she will die herself, and in their opinion the young woman\u2019s life is more valuable than the boy\u2019s. The creatures advise her not to take the last three steps but instead to save herself. Then they start time again. The woman manages to survive and to save the boy.</p> <p>Ihor Rosokhovatskyi\u2019s (1989) short story collection, The Last Signal, became iconic in the 1980s. This author consistently dealt with the topic of artificial intelligence and wrote a trilogy about the \"syhom\" Yuri (synthetic homo \u2013 artificial man): The Guest (1979), The Possibility of an Answer (1984), and The Last Signal (1989). Syhoms in Rosokhovatskyi\u2019s books are almost identical to Philip K. Dick\u2019s androids in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</p> <p>Rosokhovatskyi\u2019s earlier story \u201cSyhom and the Dictator\u201d (Rosokhovatskyi 1977) depicts a situation where logic and freedom defeat evil will. Syhom is built by the head of a business corporation known as the Dictator, who deliberately restricts Syhom\u2019s access to information. The Dictator seeks to build a world based on strict rationality. Syhom gets his energy by consuming adenosine triphosphate, which can only be obtained from living things, and this causes death in people or animals.</p> <p>When his energy level decreased and there was a need to restore it, Syhom goes to the hospital, where he finds a dying patient. This person is a professor of biochemistry who asks Syhom who he is and why he came to see him. Syhom replies that his energy resources have dwindled, so he had come to pump adenosine triphosphate from the professor. Without a shadow of fear, the scientist says, \u201cI understand,\u201d and offers to help Syhom complete the formula for a new type of artificial protein that might come in handy when building \u201cnew organs\u201d for him. When Syhom replies that he cannot stay, because the Dictator has ordered him to conquer the world, the professor remarks that he should read in books how all previous attempts to conquer the world have ended. Syhom replies that the Dictator forbids reading books in libraries. Then the professor declares: \u201cYou must do what people always do \u2013 break the ban.\u201d (Rosokhovatskyi 1977, 231)</p> <p>Syhom has not been in contact with the Dictator for six weeks. When he returns, he reveals that he has created new organs for himself that allow him to feed on solar energy, and he no longer needs to kill people or animals in order to survive. In addition, Syhom says that he does not intend to conquer the world, as he was ordered. Hearing this, the Dictator commits suicide. Syhom responds, \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable.\u201d (Rosokhovatskyi 1977, 234)</p> <p>In Rosokhovatskyi\u2019s story, \u201cThe Missing Link,\u201d Syhom rebuilds his body in such a way that it now consists of plasma. There is nothing human left in him, so he does not feel any emotions toward a human, and does not want to help him because he does not see any practical sense in it. Syhom wants to explore space and discover the fundamental laws of the universe, but he lacks one link to understand these processes. After talking with the cosmonaut, he understands that this link is compassion.</p> <p>In these two works, it is noticeable that Rosokhovatskyi considers syhoms to be inferior, without emotional intelligence and other traits that are inherent in a person. However, such an attitude is clearly anthropocentric. The author simply wants the \u201cmissing link,\u201d some missing brick of another non-human mind to belong to man, because the human mind, according to Rosokhovatskyi, is perfect. There is no evidence to support this assumption. We do not know exactly how artificial intelligence will work, or whether a human will be interested in it.</p> <p>One of the most interesting SF writers of the 1980s, Viktor Polozhiy, is known for his collection of short stories Solar Wind. The author\u2019s thinking is paradoxical and unexpected. The story \u201cCoroboro\u201d is about the cautious inhabitants of the planet Coroboro who, wanting to check the intention of aliens from other worlds, first turn into heroes of their memories. Distinguishing phantoms from real people is very difficult, but some small details can give away the truth. In the story \u201cPlanet with a Hole,\u201d a housewife is worried about the burnt meat, but suddenly finds out that it is not her fault. A beam of transgalactic communication of a distant civilization had just passed through her pan. However, later it turns out that not only was her pan affected, the entire planet became \u201cleaky,\u201d and one little boy figured out how to use a flashlight battery to establish contact with an extraterrestrial mind. Then, in \u201cThe Center of the Universe,\u201d which is more of a programmatic essay, there is an interesting segment that illustrates the current state of thinking:</p> <p>In the dark gorge, the brain collapsed: three thoughts are fighting. One philosophizes, the second became in opposition to her, and he deliberately drove the third into a gorge so that it would not destroy the shaky tranquility of the first. So, this is the fourth. Long live the fourth! The one that won\u2019t let a sober thought out of the gorge. (Polozhiy 1989, 29)</p> <p>There is no place here for the propaganda of communism of the 1930s or for the unequivocal perception of the reality of the short-sighted fiction of the 1950s or even for the anarchic protest of mysticism of the 1960s. The 1980s marked the beginning of a multi-cognitive existence, when knowledge of the world was conducted simultaneously by several competing streams of consciousness, and it was never possible to say which of them was leading or which should be given priority. An advantage is something temporary that can be quickly lost under adverse conditions.</p> <p>Vasyl Holovachev wrote his first short story in 1969, but even in 2022 he has not lost fans; there are still those who are waiting for his books. In total, Holovachev wrote more than twenty novels, and more than sixty short stories. Currently, the total circulation of his books exceeds twenty million copies. However, by the end of the 1980s he had stopped publishing in Ukrainian; in 1995 he moved to Moscow and became a de facto Russian writer.</p> <p>The main theme of his novels is the collision of Earthlings (Emergency Rescue Service) with extraterrestrial intelligence. But since the 1990s, Holovachev\u2019s works have combined space fiction with esotericism, national-patriotic orientation, and Russian neo-paganism. In his novel \u201cNon-Russians are Coming\u201d (2009), Holovachev paints a large-scale picture of the struggle of freedom-loving \u201cpagan Slavs\u201d against the forces of evil. According to the author, the ancestors of the Slavs were natives of Arctic Hyperborea. He criticizes historical scholarship for disagreeing with this point of view. Positive heroes are \u201cmodern Russian pagans\u201d who choose freedom and a world without evil.</p> <p>In the author\u2019s works, the Freemasons and the Christian Church serve the dark forces, and these forces themselves are led by the Galactic Knesset and the Sanhedrin. Many of the antagonists\u2019 names are Hebrew names written from left to right. Antagonist rituals require the use of blood. The evil forces are helped by Americans and people from the Caucasus and Central Asia. In addition, the threat to Russians in the author\u2019s works comes from China.</p> <p>In the end, Holovachev\u2019s works serve to zombify Russians, to form a distorted conspiratorial picture of the world in them, and to strengthen militarism in order to provoke military aggression.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#the-1990s2000s-economic-crisis-and-re-russification","title":"The 1990s\u20132000s: Economic Crisis and Re-Russification","text":"<p>By 2000, the publication of literary science fiction (SF) in Ukraine had significantly decreased. Despite the fact that more than thirty SF writers lived in the country, their works were mostly published in Russian, becoming a part of Russian literature. The main reasons were the publishing crisis in Ukraine, the more developed Russian publishing market, and the writers\u2019 desire to find a wider audience. For this purpose, Ukrainian SF writers often resorted to the exploitation of techniques that resonated with Russian chauvinists and revanchists.</p> <p>Students and later teachers at Kharkiv State University, Dmytro Hordevskyi and Yana Botsman were fond of fantasy and the USSR. This dangerous mixture very quickly led to the fact that they lost all contact with reality and went mad on the soil of Russian imperialism. In the early 1990s, they came up with the pseudonym Alexander Zorych and wrote twenty-three novels. One of them, No Mercy, contains the following statement:</p> <p>In 2079, the last twenty US dollar bill, brought to the State Bank of Russia by the unfortunate heir of some half-mad hoarder, was purchased for one ruble and twenty-three kopecks. The green twenty was handed over to the Historical Museum \u2013 where it is to this day, anyone can see. (Zorych 2005, 37)</p> <p>Depicting life on Russian space cruisers, Hordevskyi and Botsman are certain that in the distant future they will arrange an Orthodox prayer service before battles. In the novel Moscow Time!, Alexander Pushkin, a cadet at the Military and Space Academy, explains the superiority of a Russian human over a non-Russian one in this way:</p> <p>We were never ashamed to be idiots. When everyone around believed in the Market, we believed in God. When everyone believed in the Law, we believed in Love. When everyone believed in Order, we believed in Purity and Grace. We\u2019ve never been afraid to be a little \u2026 crazy. Ivanushka the fool always goes hunting on a bad and flimsy horse, dressed in a holey caftan, in a crooked old hat, and returns with the tsar\u2019s daughter and a chest of gold. And all because Ivanushka is a fool of the humblest opinion about himself. He does not demand victories from the world and does not even hope to win. He does not care about success, justice and even a tsar\u2019s daughter. But the heavens entrust victory to him. Because they know \u2013 only Ivanushka the fool will dispose of this victory correctly. And the tsar\u2019s daughter will like him, she will definitely like him. (Zorych 2007, 112)</p> <p>Dmytro Hordevskyi is convinced that really talented authors can only appear in Russia; he considers Ukraine a countryside where no great culture can exist. After the death of the postmodernist-imperialist, Kharkiv writer Yevgeny Savenko (Limonov), he wrote:</p> <p>We, the people of Kharkiv, are especially sad today \u2013 we, in the countryside, do not produce as many writers as in these capitals of yours. (Hordevskyi 2020)</p> <p>It is very difficult to write about Ukrainian fiction at the beginning of the twenty-first century. At times it appears that it might be better to skip this period and go straight to the 2020s. A significant number of Ukrainian authors in those times literally went crazy, existing in a bizarre world of fantasy, space operas, and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>One of the most vivid examples is Donetsk SF writer, Fedir Berezin, who became the deputy of Russian terrorist Igor Girkin, who was personally responsible for the murder of the passengers of flight MH17. Berezin also fought in a tank battalion of terrorists of the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) (the Ukrainian city of Donetsk was captured by Russian terrorists), who received weapons and money from Russia.</p> <p>The following is a typical excerpt from Berezin\u2019s novel Red Stars: Nuclear Dawn:</p> <p>One of the Russians, who has been in the biological module for the third day and is officially investigating how the AIDS viruses behave in weightlessness, was listening in on the conversation of American physicists, as well as spying on them. Information was received into his biomodule through a masked eighty-meter light guide from a micro-camera assembled in Kazan from Swiss components. (Berezin 2013, 24)</p> <p>The plot of the novel is as follows:</p> <p>Coming from nowhere the aircraft carrier formation caused a terrible defeat of the invincible USA navy and disappeared, literally dissolving in the fog. Who dared to challenge the only superpower of the planet? The special services of the United States and Russia begin a joint operation to find the location of the mysterious enemy. Russian secret police (FSB) officer Roman Panin penetrates the \u2018enemy\u2019s lair\u2019, but \u2026 is it the enemy? After all, the inhabitants of World-2 are not to blame at all, that their story is somewhat different from ours and on the Eiffel Tower a USSR red banner proudly flies. (Berezin 2013, 12)</p> <p>All of Berezin\u2019s other books are far inferior to this one, in both the literary and the political sense, but it is also impossible not to mention him at all. For example, The New Yorker magazine devoted a long article to Berezin, calling him the \u201cRussian Tom Clancy\u201d (Hitt 2016, n.p.). In addition, Berezin corresponded with the founding father of American cyberpunk, Bruce Sterling, and told him that the flag of the fictional Moscow-based \u201cNovorossiya\u201d (a separatist enclave in eastern Ukraine captured by the Russian army) resembled the Confederate flag during the American Civil War. But one passage from the interview in The New Yorker is the most telling for this Ukrainian writer. In it, he says that he believes in the Matrix, because a terrorist from the DPR managed to kill five Ukrainian soldiers with his last five cartridges, although the soldiers all had automatic weapons. So gradually, from the Russian neo-paganism of Vasyl Holovachev, through the Russian chauvinism of Alexander Zorych, Russian-speaking Ukrainian writers reached terrorism.</p> <p>The duo of Russian-language writers Serhiy and Maryna Dyachenko are extremely popular in Ukraine. What they wrote is hard to call SF, though; this is fantasy. The Dyachenkos themselves call their style \u201cm-realism,\u201d obviously alluding to magical realism, and there is some truth in this. The events of some of the Dyachenkos\u2019 books take place in the modern world with all its everyday details, but witches and demons operate among ordinary people, as in the novel Obsessed. The authors\u2019 texts are quite stereotypical and completely within the limits of popular culture.</p> <p>The novel Wild Energy: Lana (Dyachenko and Dyachenko 2006) is based on an image from a video clip of popular singer Ruslana and exploits the genre features of dystopia and fantasy. The book depicts the society of the near future during an energy crisis. Energy is needed not only for devices but also for synthetic people who are charged through wires. They also depict inhabitants of the upper floors \u2013 the \u201cwild ones\u201d who fly on self-made wings and are able to generate life energy themselves. In addition, there is the Factory, where life energy is extracted from the wild and transferred to the synthetics in the city. The plant once used the energy of natural elements, but after taking too much, it crashed. Subsequently, the Factory can no longer use the elements but instead draws energy from wild people who have the will to live. The main character, synthetic Lana, unexpectedly learns that she is \u201cwild\u201d and gets acquainted with a tribe of \u201cwolves\u201d from whom she learns a special dance that allows her to generate energy. Together, the wilds and the wolves try to destroy the Factory, but eventually Lana becomes a part of it and begins to produce energy for all the synthetics.</p> <p>The Ukrainian\u2013Russian gas conflict of 2005\u20132006 between the Russian company Gazprom and the Ukrainian company Naftogaz, regarding the conditions of the gas supply to Ukraine and gas transit to European consumers, gave Wild Energy: Lana special relevance. In March 2005, the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom demanded that Ukraine pay for gas starting in 2006 at prices close to European prices (about \\(250 per 1,000 m\u00b3**). At the same time, **Gazprom** itself bought gas in **Turkmenistan** at a price of **\\)44 per 1,000 m\u00b3. The Ukrainian leadership was not ready to pay more until the last moment, and Gazprom stopped the supply on the night of January 1, 2006. Gazprom made accusations that Ukraine \u201cstarted to take unauthorized gas\u201d intended for European consumers. Representatives of Ukrainian Naftogaz denied these accusations.</p> <p>The Dyachenkos are the authors of more than twenty-five novels and more than eighty short stories. At the Eurocon-2005 congress in Glasgow, Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko were recognized as the best fiction writers in Europe. Most of their works were translated into Ukrainian and were often published simultaneously with the Russian version.</p> <p>In 2009, the Dyachenkos moved to Moscow and wrote the scripts for seven films and TV series, four of which are banned in Ukraine, because they show contempt for the Ukrainian language, people, and statehood. Furthermore, they distort and rewrite certain facts of history in favor of Russia and popularize the bodies of the aggressor state.</p> <p>The writer Henry Lion Oldie is actually a literary duo of two authors \u2013 Dmytro Gromov and Oleg Ladyzhensky. All of Oldie\u2019s works (several dozen novels) were written in Russian and intended for the Russian book market. Oldie is incredibly popular in Russia, where they have received about fifty literary awards. Stylistically, the works feature postmodern fantasy and alternative history. In the novel We Have to Live Here (Oldie and Valentinov 2005), a man-made disaster occurs in the Institute of Applied Mythology. Employees of the institute claim that in order to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, the residents of the city need to pray and make sacrifices not only to Christian saints but also to poltergeists and other mythical creatures. Gradually, fairy-tale creatures become a part of real life, but they fall into the hands of the mafia, which is greatly strengthened. Because of this, the government decides to destroy the entire population of the city.</p> <p>Oldie, the Dyachenkos, and Andriy Valentinov formed a certain literary alliance. They wrote several novels together and all of them are presented together on Oldie\u2019s website, Oldie World (Oldie 2024). They have a lot in common. The novel We Have to Live Here is an urban fantasy written in Russian, which has its roots in the novel The Master and Margarita by Russian Mikhail Bulgakov (Bulgakov 2024), as does the novel Monday Begins on Saturday by the Russian Strugatsky brothers (Strugatsky 2016). All of them exist in the Russian cultural space and can be considered Ukrainian only conditionally, but still they have many supporters in Ukraine.</p> <p>Russian-speaking Ukrainian writer Yana Dubynyanska is the author of approximately twenty books in the style of urban fantasy. One of her most interesting novels is Your Own Time (Dubynyanska 2016). It is a novel with a key, where real people are hidden behind fictional names. The action of the novel takes place during one of the two main literary events of Ukraine \u2013 the Forum of Publishers in Lviv (the other is the Book Arsenal in Kyiv). According to the author:</p> <p>There are two lines in the novel \u2013 one is realistic, the other is futuristic. In a futuristic, fantastic line, the concept of time is literalized: each person, in addition to his own space and residence, also has his own time. A person can control it: either speed it up, or, conversely, slow it down, or stop it altogether. This leaves an imprint on the life of society: when people do not have a common dimension of time, society is atomized, individualized, people need strong motivations to meet and communicate, work or personal. There is a subculture of party people who do it for the fan, but most people do not need that. Therefore, to some extent, this is a society of lonely people. Actually, \u201cyour own time\u201d is, among other things, also a metaphor for loneliness.</p> <p>The second story line of this novel takes place in our time \u2013 but here too people can do a lot with their time. For example, Arna, a young poet and musician, lives very quickly: everything is on time, she can go around the whole country in a few hours, overtaking astronomical time. And the poet Vira, an elderly woman, meets her last love and her time stops, is conserved. (Dubynyanska 2017)</p> <p>Yana Dubynyanska\u2019s novels, although written in Russian, do not contain compliments to Russian chauvinism, yet it is difficult to call them rooted in Ukrainian culture, because they are largely cosmopolitan.</p> <p>However, in the Ukrainian literature of the time another current of purely Ukrainian fantasy, based on mysticism and mythology, emerged. One of the brightest representatives of this approach is Halyna Pahutyak. She has created a legend out of her biography, claiming that she was not accepted into the university\u2019s archaeology department because she was not a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. She also considers herself to be a descendant of Count Dracula.</p> <p>Halyna Pahutyak\u2019s novel, The Servant from Dobromyl, describes the events of 1949 and the previous 800 years in the town of Dobromyl and its surroundings. The servant from Dobromyl is a dhampyr (son of a vampire and a witch). The master and mentor of the servant is the vampire Merchant from Dobromyl. They and their like-minded \u201cbees that do not lose their sting in battle and do not sleep at night\u201d (Pahutyak 2012, 117) protect people from evil, from external and internal enemies.</p> <p>The Servant from Dobromyl (Pahutyak 2012) is a Gothic fairy-tale written in the aesthetics of modernism at the beginning of the twentieth century. One feature of the novel is the complete absence of flirtations with Russian themes. The Russians are portrayed as clearly evil. As literary critic Tetyana Trofymenko noted:</p> <p>In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, evil in Pahutyak\u2019s novel takes on the unambiguous features of the Soviet empire, whose servants are identified with the image of the antichrist (for example, the Soviet Secret Police (NKVD) captain, who derives purely vampiric pleasure from blood and murder). (Trofymenko 2008)</p> <p>The author contrasts the evil of the Soviet empire with the infernal mystical evil from ancient mythology, which, in her opinion, has greater power due to ancient traditions. For this book, Halyna Pahutyak received the National Shevchenko Award for Literature.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#the-2010s-metamodern-revolution-literary-associations-and-special-studies","title":"The 2010s: Metamodern Revolution, Literary Associations, and Special Studies","text":"<p>In the 2010s, inexpensive mobile internet connection appeared in Ukraine, which allowed millions of people to be online almost continuously. This had significant cultural consequences in that the era of metamodernity began. Ukrainian writers gained access to the latest treasures of world culture in greater volume than they ever could have imagined. In addition, many of them already knew English and other languages fluently, so they could quickly learn about literary and scientific news independently, without translation. At that time, a visa-free regime with EU countries was introduced, so writers from Ukraine began to travel a lot and to attend international literary events.</p> <p>One such author is Maksym Kidruk, who has visited more than thirty countries, received a degree in software engineering in Sweden, and writes books that can be called multimedia collections. Along these lines, his recent novel, Colony: New Dark Ages (Kidruk 2002) was created together with a designer of three-dimensional objects who recreated in detail the Martian colony where the events of the book take place. According to the plot, humanity on Earth has not yet recovered from Clodis disease, which led to the largest pandemic in half a century, when a new pathogen appears that infects pregnant women exclusively. A group of immunologists is trying to determine what it is and whether its appearance is related to the neutrino bursts recorded around the planet. The population of the Martian colonies exceeds one hundred thousand inhabitants, a third of whom were born on Mars. They lose out to specialists from Earth in the race for jobs in the knowledge-intensive economy of Mars and are forced to work in low-skilled manual jobs. Colony is the first book from the fantasy series New Dark Ages about the world in the twenty-second century. This is a story about man, who despite all the achievements of civilization, does not change, and neither increasing life expectancy nor even transforming into a two-planet species will guarantee humanity\u2019s salvation.</p> <p>The urban fantasy dilogy that comprises Do Not Look Back and Be Silent and Until the Light Goes Out Forever also adheres to the principle of multimedia. A mobile application was especially created for each novel with additional details: cover animation, stories, and even a chatbot for the main character. According to the plots of both books, teenagers unexpectedly encounter the existence of a parallel reality that can both help solve problems and create new troubles.</p> <p>Svetlana Taratorina\u2019s (2019) novel Lazarus is very interesting. This is a mystical fantasy detective story written in a pseudo-retro style. Such a whimsical combination gives the author the opportunity to present completely realistic problems behind the fairy-tale backdrop, the main one being Russian chauvinism. According to the plot of the novel, detective Oleksandr Petrovich Tyurin, from the capital of the empire (a fancy version of Tsarist Russia before the First World War), comes to Kyiv, the capital of Mezha (a whimsical version of Ukraine, called \u201cthe country from the edge or near the border\u201d), in 1913. The border is inhabited by various fairy-tale characters who were literally transferred into reality from folklore and have the common name \u201cunclean force\u201d or simply \u201cevil\u201d. All the representatives of the evil force are of different nationalities from the inhabitants of the capital of the empire, and, therefore, a certain parallel arises: The people are Russians, while Ukrainians, Jews, Poles, and other non-Russians are evil.</p> <p>People constantly fight with evil spirits, organize pogroms, publish chauvinist newspapers, and the investigator himself has to investigate a crime that was probably committed by evil spirits against people: They killed a human boy whose mother married a merman (an evil spirit, the embodiment of the water element as a negative and a dangerous phenomenon), and therefore, an \u201cinterracial\u201d marriage took place. The events that take place in Lazarus share many historical parallels with real events. Each of them has its counterpart; for example, the pogrom of the unclean in Lazarus, dated 1892, is clearly the Jewish pogrom in Kyiv in 1881. However, the author herself claims that direct parallels cannot be drawn because this fictional world is not real. The border is not Ukraine, and the empire is not Russia. Such a distance allows her to always be in the space of metamodern uncertainty, where there is a constant flickering, a fluctuation of fiction and reality, seriousness and humor, primary and secondary.</p> <p>Maxim Gah\u2019s (2016) novel The Fifth Park is also a certain stylization of SF that constantly flickers between different genres. In this clearly metamodern text, we see the reality of the post-Soviet city with all its dilapidated artifacts of the USSR, which now have a rather decorative role. At the same time, however, modernity is presented, much like a cyberpunk text in the tradition of Bruce Sterling. This is seen when the technocratic utopia fails to bring the desired happiness, positivism collapses, the heroes are part of the delusion of ghostly fantasies, and the imaginary saves them from the real. This novel is distinguished from pure SF by the absence of such genre features as a clear plot and rapidly unfolding events. In The Fifth Park there are many poetic fragments that paint a picture of the character\u2019s consciousness, descriptions of architectural structures, and features of technical devices.</p> <p>Oleh Shynkarenko is a representative of the Ukrainian metamodern in science fiction. The novel Kaharlyk is a dystopian work written in 2012 (Shynkarenko 2015) about the consequences of the Russia\u2013Ukrainian war a hundred years after its end. The text is not only about the destruction of infrastructure and the depopulation of territories, it is also about the destruction of language and semantic spaces.</p> <p>As a result, a very bizarre reality appears before the reader in which the main character, Oleksandr Sahaidachny, exists in three variations:</p> <ul> <li>as a person who lost a part of his individuality along with his memory and is in search of it, traveling through the Kyiv region of Ukraine;</li> <li>as a copy of Sahaidachny\u2019s consciousness, which is part of a rebellious Russian satellite-oppositioner;</li> <li>and as a second copy of Sahaidachny\u2019s consciousness in another satellite, which has almost nothing to do with him because it is infected with the virus of Russian propaganda.</li> </ul> <p>The original Sahaidachny is trying to regain his memory by communicating with the residents of Kyiv and surrounding villages, some of whom are also copies of long-dead people recorded on morphons \u2013 special devices for making an instant copy of consciousness. A continual analytical study of the structure of individuality takes place in the novel, as well as the consequences of the impossibility of the evolution of its copy.</p> <p>The novel First Ukrainian Robots (Shynkarenko 2015) is an attempt to assess the consequences of the coexistence of artificial and natural intelligence. In the answer to this question, one cannot be sure that these two types of minds will understand each other. The book is a series of humorous sketches in the manner of Monty Python, built on the lack of common views and goals between robots and people. Robots become certain \u201cothers,\u201d a new race that people perceive only as their corrupted copy and not as personalities. Robots, in turn, do not see people at all, perceiving them solely as a temporary deviation of the algorithm.</p> <p>The novel Skull (Shynkarenko 2017) explores the roots of Russian resentment and chauvinism, which led to external aggression against Ukraine. It is full of fantastic episodes with elements of satire. Thus, in one of them, the archetypal couple of a maniac and a girl in love with him, traveling through the fabulous Russian territories, unexpectedly fall into the captivity of a hut on chicken legs, a kind of walking drone, developed by the Ministry of Defense and now heading up a battalion of huts to conquer the countries of the West. Trying to escape the shack, the couple studies the manual, How to Rule a Shack on Chicken Feet, written in a fanciful Church Slavonic slang and offering no practical advice.</p> <p>Translator and publisher Oleksiy Zhupanskyi is the author of several fantastic novels, one of the most interesting of which is God Bless You! Black GenSec! (Zhupanskyi 2017). This is a rather original postmodern urban fantasy. Zhupanskyi\u2019s novel, which differs from the typical urban fantasy, is quite well known in Ukrainian literature. It keeps a constant ironic distance from the image, which gives the impression that the author wanted to write a book in some other style and on some other topic, but was forced to hide behind popular genre templates and juggle stereotypes, using them as a mask.</p> <p>The novel God Bless You! Black GenSec! serves as a haunting chronicle of mystical quests. It commences in eastern Ukraine, traverses the protagonist\u2019s childhood, which is revealed to be vastly different from his previous perceptions, and concludes in the capital with a foreboding climax involving an otherworldly game. Though the exact stakes are unclear and ambiguous, they are undeniably of the utmost significance.</p> <p>The heroes immediately find themselves in a whirlwind of extremely confusing events. They collude and betray, carry out dark corruption rituals, obtain scarce goods, blackmail and kill, revive the dead, and conduct meetings of the parliament. As a result, the \u201csoft irrational\u201d is removed from the deputies, and the rest are killed. They get to the mysterious Red Collector, and then to the Vernadskyi Library vault, where they study the secret archives of the Tablets of Power, and get the keys to the last door. Behind this door, perhaps, the grand prize awaits them, which no one really knows anything about, other than the fact that it is the most desirable for everyone.</p> <p>Oleksiy Dekan became one of the first authors of fantastic mash-ups in his novel The Kaidash Family Against Zombies (Dekan 2021). The novel is a realistic social and everyday novel by Ukrainian writer Ivan Semenovych Nechuy-Levytskyi, written in 1878. In the story, through a series of tragicomic situations from the life of the Kaidash family, the damage from spiritual disunity is demonstrated, which leads to selfishness, discord, and inept use of the legacy of previous generations. In this work, the problems of the peasantry, which were pressing at that time, were artistically reproduced, including the impoverished life of farmers, the destruction of the patriarchal system, and the ignorance and superstition of the peasants. Dekan depicted in his mash-up novel the struggle of the Kaidash family against an influx of zombies, which in the text are called the \u201cliving dead.\u201d The word \u201czombie\u201d is a special term for the cover, apparently to increase the appeal of the novel. Such an absurd combination, on the one hand, completely destroys the original intention of Nechuy-Levytsky, and on the other hand, gives birth to a completely new logic when a typical genre novel about zombies suddenly acquires an additional dimension in the space of classical Ukrainian literature of the nineteenth century. The novel is also in a certain sense anti-colonial, because it addresses the struggle of Ukrainian peasants with the remnants of the inhabitants of the Russian empire, where everyone turned into the living dead because they played with black magic. Such a picture is a vivid illustration of the Russian\u2013Ukrainian war, which is an anti-colonial war, and the Ukrainians are forced to repel the attacks of Russians zombified by Russian propaganda (the modern equivalent of black magic).</p> <p>A very important author of the 2010s was Yuri Shcherbak, a representative of the literature of the \u201csixtiers.\u201d He should probably be considered in the section next to Oles Berdnyk, especially since they share many common stylistic and worldview characteristics, the main one of which is religious mysticism. Both Berdnyk and Shcherbak distrust the idea of technological progress, which, in their opinion, will lead humanity to a dead end. Instead, they propose focusing on the search for an irrational mystical insight that has no scientific or logical basis, not noticing that such \u201cinsight\u201d is a real dead end because there are no recipes for its achievement and it is a purely speculative hypothesis.</p> <p>In the 1960s, Shcherbak did not write SF and abandoned literary work as soon as Ukraine gained independence in 1991. He began to engage in politics and for many years worked as the ambassador of Ukraine to the USA, Mexico, and Canada. However, by the end of the 2000s, Yuri Shcherbak sensed the approach of catastrophic events for Ukrainian history and created a trilogy of apocalyptic and dystopian novels, the action of which takes place in the second half of the twenty-first century.</p> <p>The first novel in Shcherbak\u2019s trilogy, The Time of the Dead-Christs: Mirages of the Year 2077 (Shcherbak 2020), describes the world shortly after the Third World War. A number of large cities, such as Detroit, Seoul, and Jerusalem, were destroyed by nuclear explosions. Nation-states have either collapsed and are in decline, or have joined unions. The world currency globo has been introduced, and the real power belongs to corporations.</p> <p>The formation of the Black Horde began in Mongolia, a union of Muslim and Islamized states that gradually took over Central Asia, Siberia, and the countries of the Near East. This led to the termination of the latter\u2019s oil exports. Russia disintegrated into separate states, most of which were part of the Black Horde, the Chinese Celestial empire, and Japan. In 2076, its part, known as the Empire of the Double-headed Eagle with its capital in Moscow, fell into the course of a huge Muslim uprising and became a component of the Horde.</p> <p>Ukraine remained outside the Unions, but it remained a valuable partner for many supranational entities. In 2048\u20132052 there was a Romanian\u2013Ukrainian war, and in 2068\u20132070 there was a Moscow\u2013Ukrainian war, both of which were won by Ukraine. Neighboring countries prepared for raids on Ukraine to capture food, the lack of which was felt more and more acutely.</p> <p>The Black Horde seeks to assimilate the Slavs in order to oppose other alliances and eventually achieve world domination. The Horde has numerous agents among the powerful of Ukraine, and, in order to disunite the state, it uses the teaching of the death Christ sect that Christ died and did not rise again. Therefore, people have lost their connection with God and are free from traditional Christian morality.</p> <p>The continuation of the trilogy, Time of the Great Game: Phantoms of 2079 and Time of the Tyrant: Epiphany of 2084, have all the shortcomings of the first part. They both contain an extremely confusing illogical plot, built on popular conspiracy theories and geopolitical thrillers. For example, it says that the World Government allegedly planned the Third World War in order to establish a new world order. Its goal was to eliminate all nation-states, replacing them with unions, to introduce a single English language and a new world religion \u2013 the worship of space and time.</p> <p>According to the plan of the World Government, for the survival of humanity, it is necessary to reduce the population to 1 billion\u20131.5 billion and to divide it into the castes of the wealthy and the debtors. In 2084, Ukraine remained the last stronghold of Orthodoxy, after the Islamists captured Istanbul. Pope Clement XV plans to unite the Catholic and Orthodox churches to oppose the Global Jihad led by Omar al-Bakr.</p> <p>Creating aggressive Muslim movements around the world, he was defeated by the Black Horde, which quickly disintegrated after the Great Flash, but did not abandon its plans for world domination.</p> <p>The third novel ends with a description of the results of an expedition to a space object called Heavenly Jerusalem. Only one astronaut admits what he saw there \u2014 a repository of the souls of all living and non-living things, in the center of which was God. After the death of the bodies, they are purified in this heavenly city and returned to be reborn into new bodies. However, there exists another memory from a Ukrainian astronaut, who learned that the soul of the hero, unlike the souls of many other rulers, was freed from the burden of sin through repentance and received Enlightenment.</p> <p>In this book, typical of the literature of the \u201csixtiers,\u201d everything is built on mystical insights and a baseless conclusion is made that the problems of humanity are connected with the decline of traditional Christian morality, which was bequeathed to us by distant ancestors.</p> <p>The novels are too anachronistic; their style is reminiscent of Tom Clancy\u2019s spy thrillers, and in some places they impress with naivety and bad taste, where magical realism is mixed with the grotesque, but this is not as important as the sense of impending disaster, which Yuri Shcherbak manages to convey very accurately.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#literary-associations","title":"Literary Associations","text":"<p>In the 1980s\u20132000s, the vast majority of SF festivals and the activities of literary associations took place in the usual mode of face-to-face meetings, but in the late 2000s they mainly moved online, which contributed to a significant revival of their productivity.</p> <p>The SF literary association, Star Fortress, was founded in 2008 by Serhii Torenko and Mykhailo Zipunov, with the participation of Oleg Silin. The original idea was to create a platform for a contest of fantastic stories in the Ukrainian language, where the participants themselves would evaluate each other. It was decided to hold competitions twice a year. A mini-story contest, held every summer, was later added to the \u201cbig\u201d contest. Among the currently well-known authors who participated in or won competitions were Igor Silivra, Nataliya Matolinets, Svitlana Taratorina, Dara Korniy, Natalka Lishchinska, and Vladyslav Ivchenko.</p> <p>Over the past few years, twenty-seven major contests have been held, and more than two thousand short stories were submitted. The twenty-eighth was supposed to start on March 3, 2022, but due to the full-scale invasion of Russia, the competitions were put on hold.</p> <p>Cooperation with the Kyiv Club of Fantasy Fans \u201cPortal\u201d helped the association to start master classes at conventions (\u201cPortal,\u201d \u201cDays of Fiction in Kyiv\u201d). The winner of the competition and four to six participants selected by the administration had the opportunity to hear an analysis of their own story from an invited writer (literary critic). The first master was Maria Galina; among the other masters were Volodymyr Aryenev, Volodymyr Yeshkilev, Anton Sanchenko, Oleksandr Mykhed, and Serhiy Oksenyk. Master classes, as well as competitions, were held twice a year.</p> <p>Since 2012, the association has begun to cooperate more actively with the country\u2019s general literary festivals \u2013 the Book Arsenal and the Lviv Forum of Publishers. At the Book Arsenal, Star Fortress later became the curator of a special program on SF. Further, SF events from Star Fortress were also held at the Zaporizhia and Severodonetsk book festivals, the Cherkasy Book Festival, and at four mass culture festivals: Yukon, Eastern Bastion, KyivSteamCon, and KyivComicCon.</p> <p>After 2014, when the conventions of the old formation ceased to exist, the association began to hold master classes at general literary festivals, created a separate event around the master class, and also joined the creation of the LiTerraCon fiction festival, which was held from 2014 to 2017.</p> <p>Star Fortress compiled two almanacs of fantastic stories based on the results of contests, and compiled the collections Pocket Mandruary (Travel Guide), Travels by Fantastic Transport (KM-Buks), Independence Agency (NK Bohdan), and Legendary of Strange Cities (Ranok).</p> <p>Since 2020, the association\u2019s website has begun to cover many more events surrounding SF in Ukraine and the world, including presentations of books by Ukrainian authors, reviews of foreign awards, community initiatives related to SF, and so on. In addition, three special projects were launched on the website: the blog \u201cCopyright in Your Own Words\u201d, a series of interviews with Ukrainian authors, \u201c42 Fictions about the Incredible, Literature and Everything Else\u201d (2020\u20132021), and \u201cReading the Future Victory\u201d (spring 2022). Since 2016, Oleg and Alyona Silin have represented the Star Fortress team.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#scientific-research","title":"Scientific Research","text":"<p>During these times, the first thorough study of \u201cUkrainian Science Fiction: Historical and Thematic Perspectives,\u201d an SF monograph by the Canadian researcher of Ukrainian origin Walter (Volodymyr) Smyrniw, appeared. The author worked on the book for several decades; the study was published in English in Switzerland in 2013. Separate sections were published by the author in the form of articles in Canadian and Polish scientific periodicals.</p> <p>The analysis of works of Ukrainian fiction is grouped into blocks of topics: utopia, space travel, encounters with aliens, artificial creatures, humor in Ukrainian fiction, and a number of others. Some chapters are devoted to fantastic concepts or individual works of specific fantastic writers. At the end of the book there is an appendix, a selected bibliography of Ukrainian fiction compiled by Vitaly Karatsupa.</p> <p>The author, Walter Smyrniw, traces the chronological development of Ukrainian fiction from its inception to the 1990s. A separate section is devoted to the harbingers of SF in Ukrainian literature. In contrast to similar Soviet studies, the book contains significant factual material that illuminates the history of the genre in the territory of Western Ukraine, which was part of Poland in 1919\u20131939, as well as the development of fantastic literature among the Ukrainian diaspora. Smyrniw discovered or brought back from oblivion numerous names of Ukrainian SF writers.</p> <p>On the basis of new materials, he made many innovative conclusions about how Ukrainian writers depict typical fantastic plots. For example, one of Smyrniw\u2019s very interesting remarks concerns the definition of original artistic thinking and the value of an artistic work:</p> <p>Not all of them [new SF writers] were talented or creative authors. In fact, a number of graphomaniacs appeared who only created imitation stories based on certain clich\u00e9s and published them mainly in newspapers and magazines. At the same time, some extremely creative writers-innovators entered the literature and introduced many new themes and concepts into Ukrainian science fiction. (Smyrniw 2013, 379)</p> <p>Smyrniw also made apt remarks about the two main trends in the development of Ukrainian fiction in the twentieth century:</p> <ul> <li>Positivism is most vividly represented by the works of Ihor Rosokhovatskyi, who sees the future of humanity in technological progress.  </li> <li>In relation to the mysticism of Oles Berdnyk, who does not believe in technical progress, seeing the future can only be in knowledge and interaction with mystical entities that are not amenable to positive evidentiary research.</li> </ul> <p>Neither Ukrainian Russian-language fiction nor the domestic SF literature of the 2000s and 2010s is considered in Walter Smyrniw\u2019s monograph.</p> <p>Solomiya Khorob\u2019s dissertation (Khorob 2017) is dedicated to Ukrainian science fiction and presents the vectors of the genre\u2019s formations, providing grounds for arguing the following conclusions:</p> <ol> <li>The concepts of \u201cfiction\u201d and \u201cfantastic\u201d are central to works with artistic conventions. The latter acts as a special type of thinking-feeling and artistic vision, introduced into literary circulation by French scientist Tzvetan Todorov. It is justified that literary fiction in artistic practice is realized in two guises:  </li> <li>fiction as a technique (in the form of a component, element, detail) in nonfiction texts  </li> <li> <p>fiction as a concept (as the main thematic and genre-creating factor of the work)</p> </li> <li> <p>There are three main genres: fantasy proper, SF, and fantasy. But, taking into account the tendency toward interpenetration of genres, their hybridization, we attribute utopia and dystopia to those phenomena that are already developing today in the direction of fiction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fiction as a literary concept is a dynamic metagenre with a clear dominance of the fantastic (unusual, unreal, mysterious, miraculous, conditional), which reflects, through the interaction of content and form, human and social problems, regardless of the time and space reflected by the writers. It further reflects the hero-characters (real-virtual, mythological, historical, fairy-tale, imaginary), which is mutually determined by means and methods of modeling an unusual world and its components.</p> </li> <li> <p>The peculiarity of the genre of fantasy proper (the so-called pure fiction) is its function to violate the norms of reality, causing hesitation in both the reader and the characters of the work. Examples of this subspecies in contemporary red literature are the novel Cave by Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko and the collection of short prose by Yaroslav Melnyk, Why I Will Not Tire of Living. In the works of these writers, the most noticeable thing is the artistic conventions they follow, that is, they have fantasy as their main feature. Despite this, hesitating between real and unreal, and between possible and unbelievable, in the end the reader/character accepts the writers\u2019 \u201crules of the game.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>The framework of science does not allow realizing all aspirations and possibilities of technical/natural science intelligence; therefore, scientists resort to artistic creativity. Modern SF is represented by Viktor Savchenko\u2019s works From the Afterlife \u2013 Incognito (Savchenko 2003) and Under the Sign of a Cricket (Savchenko 2004), as well as Volodymyr Yeshkilev\u2019s Shadow of the Predecessor (Yeshkilev 2011). Both the author-scientist and the writer-humanitarian are based on the rational-fantasy concept, the harmonization of scientific and artistic discourses. Attention is paid to the ability of the authors to create plot\u2013plot collisions with the ability to psychologize the thoughts and reflections of the main characters. The focus is on intellectual analysis and the illusion of the reliability of the simulated reality and the corresponding attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contemplating the fantasy novels of Marina and Serhiy Dyachenko and Volodymyr Aryenev, Khorob notes their connection with mythology, folklore, and history with a primate ritual over myth. There are irrational motives of sorcery and magic, which are also connected with the realistic method of narration. Personal motivations are possible, and there is a binary ethical opposition of good and evil, as well as plot components, such as escape and consolation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Based on the artistic experience of modern fantastic literature and the main provisions of receptive aesthetics, Khorob proves that utopia/dystopia develops within the framework of the fantastic metagenre. It was noted that the main criterion in utopia is a suitable idea based on the achievements of science and technology, spiritual and moral maxims, and fantastic fiction. All features are reflected primarily in the chronotopic section. When analyzing dystopia, we consider the example of fiction as a concept and fiction as a method (the novels of Yuri Shcherbak) (Khorob 2017).</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Studying the history of Ukrainian SF, one cannot fail to notice how carefully it repeats all the twists and turns of Ukrainian history. It is worth remembering that any fiction is only an image of the surrounding reality, modified with the help of the postulates of positivism and mysticism. Such a strategy is not unique because any literary work is a modified image of reality, even one that is considered realistic.</p> <p>A realistic image is impossible due to natural reduction. The author simply cannot take into account all the elements of reality, but chooses only those that he remembers and considers more pleasant for himself than others. This is how Ukrainian SF writers work. In the 1920s and 1930s, they frantically promoted communism; in the 1940s and 1950s they began to depict the technological utopia of the times of communism, which had already arrived. In the 1960s they were fascinated by mysticism; in the 1970s and 1980s the Golden Age of Ukrainian SF came, a time that was without political propaganda, and that was soon replaced by existentialism and postmodernism. In the 1990s and 2000s, Ukrainian SF writers massively began to write novels in favor of Russian imperialism and the wildest forms of chauvinism.</p> <p>After 2010, a new generation appeared, educated in the latest examples of European and American metamodernism, which reached us through popular cinema and mobile internet usage. In the 2020s, a new Golden Age should come, which will repeat the success of the dead and almost forgotten authors of the 1980s. Although we do not remember them, the digital trace of their lives remains in online libraries, like a kind of dead city that lives without noticing its own death.</p>"},{"location":"insiders/sf-two/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Baudrillard, Jean. 1994.

The index page usually shows only a short excerpt and a link that the user can click to navigate to the full post.</p> <p>Metadata: both the index page and the post itself list information such as when you published the post, when you updated it, who the author is, and what the expected reading time is.</p> <p>Slug: since the blog posts are primarily arranged by time and not into a hierarchy, their URLs do not reflect such a structure. Instead, each post's URL contains a shortened description, the slug, which is usually derived from the first heading in the post.</p> <p>Navigation: the main navigation structure is the timeline, which you can subdivide into categories. The main index page shows the more recent posts while an archive section allows access to older ones, organized by year. In addition, posts can be tagged and tag index pages provide an additional navigation structure based on content.</p> <p>You can see all these elements on the Material for MkDocs blog.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/blogs/basic/#setting-up-your-blog","title":"Setting up your blog","text":"<p>The blog plugin is part of Material for MkDocs but you need to configure it in the <code>mkdocs.yml</code>.</p> <p>Set up a blog</p> <p>If you have not done so already, create a project for your blog, then edit the <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file to make sure it has the following content:</p> <pre><code>site_name: Blog Tutorial\nsite_description: an example blog set up following the tutorial\nsite_url: http://www.example.com\n\ntheme:\n  name: material\n\nplugins:\n  - search\n  - blog\n</code></pre> <p>The blog plugin will create a directory structure for your blog posts if it does not exist, so simply run <code>mkdocs serve</code> to get:</p> <pre><code>docs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 blog\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.md\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 posts\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md\n</code></pre> <p>Now create your first blog post in <code>docs/blog/posts</code>.

Tags are useful for making related content easily discoverable even if it is in different parts of the navigation hierarchy.</p> <p>You may have a tutorial like this one as well as a more comprehensive setup guide and reference documentation. Adding the same tag to all three shows that they are related. As you will see, it is possible to navigate from a tagged page to the tag index and, from there, to other pages that carry the same tag.</p> <p>Enable the plugin and add tags</p> <p>First, you need to add the plugin to your <code>mkdocs.yml</code>:</p> <pre><code>plugins:\n  - search\n  - blog:\n      archive_date_format: MMMM yyyy\n      categories_allowed:\n        - Holidays\n        - News\n  - tags\n</code></pre> <p>Once this is done, you can add tags to posts in the page header:</p> <pre><code>---\ndate:\n  created: 2023-12-31\n  updated: 2024-01-02\nauthors:\n  - material\ncategories:\n  - Holidays\ntags:\n  - new year\n  - hogmanay\n  - festive season\n---\n</code></pre> <p>You should see the tags that you defined at the top of the post. However, at the moment that is it. While the blog plugin automatically creates an index page for categories, the tags plugin does not do the same for tags. This is because the tags plugin is not specific for blogs. You can use it for any site content, so it is not obvious were the tag index should go.</p> <p>You can configure a basic tag index using the public version of Material for MkDocs. The Insider Edition supports this as well, of course, but also provides an alternative index mechanism that allows for an arbitrary number of tag indexes, scoped listings, shadow tags, nested tags, and much more.</p> <p>Adding a tags index</p> Basic tag indexInsider Edition <p>To configure a tag index using the public version, add a <code>tags_file</code> entry to your configuration of the tags plugin and configure it in your <code>nav</code> section. Remember to add a colon at the end of the existing <code>tags</code> entry.</p> <pre><code>plugins:\n    - search\n    - blog:\n        archive_date_format: MMMM yyyy\n        categories_allowed:\n            - Holidays\n            - News\n    - tags:\n        tags_file: blog/tags.md\n\nnav:\n    - Home: index.md\n    - Install: install.md\n    - Usage: usage.md\n    - Blog:\n        - blog/index.md\n        - Tags: blog/tags.md\n</code></pre> <p>The tag index will be appended to the configured page, which you should now create at the location specified.</p> <p>Note that you can put the tag index page anywhere in your primary navigation, so if you are using tags elsewhere instead of just in your blog then you may want to have the tag index outside the blog section of the navigation.</p> <p>To add a tag index, you add a placeholder in a Markdown file to tell the plugin to insert an index at that point. This means that you can add content before and after the index. Crucially, you can add placeholders in multiple pages, each with a configuration of what subset of tags should be displayed in the index.</p> <p>The simplest index page looks like this. Create it under <code>docs/tags.md</code>.</p> <pre><code># Tag index\n&lt;!-- material/tags --&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now, you may want to keep the tags for your blog separate from tags you use in the rest of your page. You can achieve this by assigning the tag index a scope. Put the following under <code>docs/blog/tags.md</code>:</p> <pre><code># Tag index  for the blog\n&lt;!-- material/tags { scope: true } --&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>You now have two index pages: one covers the whole site and one covers only the blog. Add both to the navigation:</p> <pre><code>nav:\n    - Home: index.md\n    - Tags: tags.md\n    - Blog:\n        - blog/index.md\n        - blog/tags.md\n</code></pre> <p>The tags plugin in the Insider Edition is an incredibly powerful tool and we can only scratch the surface of what is possible with it.

You also need to write a function that returns that function.</p> <p>Say you want to define two slugify functions that you can switch between. The first one returns a slug similar to what the default slugify function produces.

All of them eventually become the faces of characters in films about war, and the expressions of these faces\u2014emotions, gazes, gestures\u2014personify these tragic events in history for us. No one knows how everything actually happened, so acting becomes a substitute for real memories. If an actor possesses an expressive appearance and performs convincingly, their portrayal can overshadow the memories of real events and create a \"real\" reality, which can be used for propaganda if the film's producers so desire.  </p> <p>This assertion is best illustrated by the performance of Semen Svashenko (Tymosh) in Oleksandr Dovzhenko's film \u201cZvenyhora\u201d (1928). Dovzhenko, a committed communist and Russian imperialist who adapted his views to save his life and win favor with the Moscow leadership, discarded the typical red propaganda poster that aimed to brand \u201cUkrainian bourgeois nationalism,\u201d ridicule the Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic, and forever unite thoroughly Russified Ukrainians with Moscow Bolshevism. This stance led to a conflict with the scriptwriters, Mykola (Mike) Johansen and Yuriy Tyutyunnyk.  </p> <p>Dovzhenko recounted their reaction in his 1939 autobiography:  </p> <p>\u201cThe script contained a lot of nonsense and clear nationalist tendencies. That\u2019s why I revised it by 90 percent, resulting in the authors demonstratively \u2018removing their names,\u2019 marking the start of my disagreement with the Kharkiv writers.\u201d  </p> <p>At the meeting of Ukrainian writers convened by VUFKU (All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration) on September 13\u201314, 1928, Johansen also expressed his position of disagreement with the production of films saturated with propagandistic communist undertones:  </p> <p>\u201cOf course, we need to produce more films with our Soviet content, but of the type that American films were. And in this regard, there are none. It\u2019s not for me to tell you which films the proletariat loves the most, but this gap is not only remaining unfilled, but there is even an avoidance of it, and there is a danger of the demise of artistic films.\u201d  </p> <p>Consequently, the authors of the \"wrong\" script, Johansen and Tyutyunnyk, were executed, while Dovzhenko received the Order of Lenin, two Stalin Prizes, and one Lenin Prize.  </p> <p>In this film, Semen Svashenko plays the role of communist Tymosh, whose brother Pavlo, a petlyurivets<sup>1</sup>, flees to Prague after the collapse of the Ukrainian People's Republic, leading a miserable and absurd life, constantly attempting suicide.  </p> <p> Tymosh commands his own execution. Screenshot from Oleksandr Dovzhenko's film \u201cZvenyhora\u201d (1928). </p> <p>Dovzhenko clearly mocks the UPR, striving to trample its legacy into the dirt. Interestingly, there was a significant diplomatic presence of the UPR in Prague at that time, which likely bothered loyal Leninists.  </p> <p> \u201cAnd in emigration, in Prague, sweeping the street with his wide trousers, walks a cossack\u2026\u201d A screenshot from Oleksandr Dovzhenko's film \u201cZvenyhora\u201d (1928). </p> <p>Since the film is silent, the actors must compensate for the lack of dialogue with emphatic theatrical expressions and strike poster-like, even comical poses. Semen Svashenko frequently flashes his eyes and makes tense gestures with his hands, reminiscent of a worker on a modern automobile assembly line.  </p> <p>This is particularly evident in scenes depicting World War I, when he ventures into German trenches with his bare hands or commands his own execution.  </p> <p>The talented actor Amvrosiy Buchma also devoted his talent to Moscow propaganda. In one of his early films, McDonald, he ridiculed the \"decaying West,\" and in The Feat of a Scout, which greatly pleased Stalin, he portrayed a submissive Little Russian, agronomist Leshchuk.  </p> <p>After his arrest, an enraged German occupier interrogates him:  </p> <p>\u201cUkrainian or Russian?\u201d \u201cIn this case, it doesn\u2019t matter... Well, a Ukrainian,\u201d he replies.  </p> <p>Buchma was a leading actor in the famous \"Berezil\" theater, an agent of the Cheka<sup>2</sup>, and received the Order of Lenin and two Stalin Prizes.  </p> <p>However, it is important to note that Buchma occasionally displayed vivid human emotions. Notably, his three-minute role as a gasping German soldier in Dovzhenko\u2019s powerful expressionist film \u201cArsenal\u201d is striking. This crazed, dying laughter, with an open mouth where half the teeth are missing, appears grotesque and especially haunting in context: it seems that death itself is mocking.  </p> <p> Amvrosiy Buchma as a German soldier in Dovzhenko\u2019s film \u201cArsenal\u201d (1929). </p> <p>Nataliya Uzhviy received the Order of Lenin for her role as partisan Olena Kostiuk in Mark Donskoy's film \u201cThe Rainbow\u201d (1943). Once captured by the enemy, she faces a harrowing choice:  </p> <p>The Nazis will either execute her newborn child or she must betray her fellow partisans.  </p> <p>as a partisan Olena Kostiuk  Nataliya Uzhviy as a partisan Olena Kostiuk in Mark Donskoy's film \u201cThe Rainbow\u201d (1943). </p> <p>Olena chooses loyalty to her comrades. Was it really like that? How did real women behave in such situations? We don\u2019t learn this from \u201cThe Rainbow\u201d, yet Nataliya Uzhviy's portrayal is so convincing\u2014full of pathos and emotion\u2014that viewers instantly believe her dedication to Lenin.  </p> <p>In this film, the Germans are caricatured as cruel, speaking Russian with a comical German accent, while Olena Kostiuk\u2019s Russian is always flawless. We are led to believe that she is prepared to sacrifice her child for the USSR's victory in World War II.  </p> <p>In his book \u201cCinema and Radio Propaganda in the Second World War\u201d, researcher Kenneth Short noted that \u201cThe Rainbow\u201d became:  </p> <p>\u201cThe most potent and effective example of Soviet propaganda throughout the war.\u201d  </p> <p>The American ambassador in Moscow personally recommended the film to US President Franklin Roosevelt for viewing. Consequently, it was honored with:  </p> <ul> <li>The Grand Prize from the Association of Film Critics of the United States </li> <li>The Supreme Award from the Daily News for the best foreign film at the American box office in 1944 </li> <li>A prize from the National Council of Film Critics </li> </ul> <p>Ivan Mykolaichuk not only starred as Petro, the son of the musician Dzvonar, in Yuriy Illenko's film \u201cThe White Bird Marked with Black\u201d (1971), but also co-authored the screenplay for this remarkable film.  </p> <p>The story unfolds from 1937 to 1947 in Bukovina, during which Romania lost this territory to Soviet Ukraine. Illenko's film stands out from most other films of its time, not only for its complex and original imagery but also for employing the Ukrainian language in its dialogues.  </p> <p>However, the language retains a strong local West-Ukrainian accent, making parts difficult to understand. It avoids the simplistic slogans typical of propaganda. Yet, political themes do permeate the film.  </p> <p>Petro (Ivan Mykolaichuk) fights with a Hutsul-UPA<sup>3</sup> member because the latter supports Hitler, while Petro\u2019s father has kissed the hand of a Soviet commander.  </p> <p> Ivan Mykolaichuk (in profile) as Petro, the son of the musician Dzvonar in Yuriy Illenko's film \u201cThe White Bird Marked with Black\u201d (1971). </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the son of the Dzvonar soon enlists in the Red Army, albeit not out of communist zeal; rather, his choice stems from a premonition of Nazi defeat. Meanwhile, Petro\u2019s brother, Orest, has joined the UPA, leading to a tragic conflict within the Dzvonar family.  </p> <p>Mykolaichuk successfully crafts a complex and contradictory character, making this film timeless, unlike Mykolaichuk's brief appearance in the TV series \u201cLiberation\u201d (artilleryman Savchuk, part one \u201cThe Arc of Fire\u201d, 1968).  </p> <p>In a brief scene, Ivan Mykolaichuk takes aim at advancing German tanks but is shot in the head and collapses. Russian captain Serhiy Tsvetaev (Mykola Olyalin) quickly takes his place, and a moment later, the tank destroys the artillery unit.  </p> <p>A dazed Savchuk then cries out with an obvious Ukrainian accent:  </p> <p>\u201cComrade captain, there are five shells left!\u201d  </p> <p>Later, a nurse in love with Tsvetaev rushes onto the battlefield. And where is Savchuk?  </p> <p>This no longer concerns anyone; he has merely served as an inconspicuous backdrop for the heroic Russian captain.  </p> <p>Interestingly, Russian actor Mykola Olyalin, who portrayed Tsvetaev, transitioned into a Ukrainian actor that same year.  </p> <p> Ivan Mykolaichuk as artilleryman Savchuk in Yuri Ozerov\u2019s TV series \u201cLiberation\u201d (1968). </p> <p>Though he spoke no Ukrainian, he starred in Dovzhenko Film Studio projects, performed at Ukrainian cultural venues, received the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise, earned the title of People\u2019s Artist of Ukraine, was awarded a lifetime scholarship from President Viktor Yushchenko and buried at the Baikove cemetery<sup>4</sup> in Kyiv.  </p> <p>However, \"Ukrainization\" did not stop Olyalin from participating in the chauvinistic series \u201cRussian Project\u201d (even acting alongside Nikita Mikhalkov, who holds a deep-seated hatred for Ukraine), which contributed to the rise of revanchism and militarism in Russian society, ultimately culminating in war.  </p> <p>Leonid Bykov's role as Captain Oleksiy Tytarenko, nicknamed Maestro\u2014the commander of the second squadron\u2014in the Soviet cinematic masterpiece \u201cOnly Old Men Are Going to Battle\u201d (1974) occupies a special place among Ukrainian film actors.  </p> <p>Bykov also directed this film, allowing himself liberties that might not have been well-received even in the USSR of 1974.  </p> <p> Leonid Bykov portrays Captain Oleksiy \u201cMaestro\u201d Tytarenko in \u201cOnly Old Men Are Going to Battle\u201d (1974). </p> <p>His monologue:  </p> <p>\u201cHow did you not notice? We fought over my Ukraine today!\u201d </p> <p>marks a pivotal moment\u2014for the first time in Soviet cinema, Bykov portrays an active, charismatic, witty, and even cheeky Ukrainian in a way that is difficult for us to appreciate today.  </p> <p>Notice how he responds with:  </p> <p>\u201cYou are welcome!\u201d </p> <p>in Ukrainian instead of Russian.  </p> <p>In this context, these Ukrainian words do not convey gratitude but sound almost like an insult.  </p> <p>Unfortunately, this talented film has become one of the brightest examples of the so-called \u201cSoviet heroic narrative\u201d, which eventually paved the way for Russian aggression against Ukraine.  </p> <p>Underneath this film\u2019s YouTube postings, many comments echo sentiments like:  </p> <p>\u201cHow clearly the unity of Soviet soldiers from different nationalities is depicted in the fight against fascism.\u201d </p> <p>Moreover, it is worth noting that the Ministry of Culture of the Ukrainian SSR attempted to ban the film.  </p> <p>Hleb Shandybin, the acting director of the Dovzhenko Film Studio, convinced the Head of State Cinema of the Ukrainian SSR, Vasyl Bolshak, not to create a Ukrainian dubbing for this picture (which was very unusual, because it was typically done), claiming:  </p> <p>\u201cThe theme of internationalism would disappear.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, genuine internationalism appears to be possible only in the Russian language! </p> <p>One should also make a separate observation. When analyzing 20<sup>th</sup>-century Ukrainian films, a palpable artificiality in restricting the Ukrainian language is evident:  </p> <p>If a film had potential for commercial success and broad distribution, it would likely exist exclusively in Russian. </p> <p>The case of \u201cAfter Two Hares\u201d (1961) is telling, as it was filmed in Ukrainian but later translated into Russian when producers recognized its commercial prospects; consequently, the Ukrainian original was \u201clost\u201d for 52 years, only to be found later in the Mariupol Film Fund.  </p> <p>This film storage, by the way, contained over 80 tons of unexamined film material, much of which was almost certainly lost forever due to destruction by Russian invaders in 2022.  </p> <p>The principle of restricting the Ukrainian language in cinema persisted well beyond the collapse of the USSR in commercial film production, only beginning to significantly decline in recent years.  </p> <p>After the USSR\u2019s disintegration, actors, liberated from Soviet censorship and the burden of Russian imperialism, began to emerge in Ukraine, yet this did not resolve complex artistic challenges.  </p> <p>Hryhoriy Gladiy managed to appear in Leonid Bykov\u2019s \u201cOnly Old Men Are Going to Battle\u201d (as an unnamed technician of the \u201cColt,\u201d Oleksandrov), but his most significant role was as Roman Shukhevych in Oles Yanchuk\u2019s \u201cUndefeated\u201d (2000).  </p> <p> Hryhoriy Gladiy as Roman Shukhevych in Oles Yanchuk\u2019s \u201cUndefeated\u201d (2000). </p> <p>Unfortunately, despite the guidance of Askold Lozynskyi, president of the World Congress of Ukrainians, this film took a close-to-Soviet \"realist\" approach, lacking vivid artistic discoveries or compelling portrayals.  </p> <p>It resembles the uninspired productions of the Dovzhenko Film Studio in the 1970s.  </p> <p>The director, Oles Yanchuk, seems either to have avoided creative exploration and unconventional directorial decisions or simply may not have been familiar with them.  </p> <p>Hryhoriy Gladiy also fails to attempt to capture the complex character of Roman Shukhevych, merely moving through scenes and delivering sterile lines as written by a far-from-ideal script of a clich\u00e9d costume drama.  </p> <p>For effective artistic representation of historical events in film, it is insufficient to merely dress actors appropriately, provide them with fitting dialogue, and start filming. </p> <p>The work of a true artist demands more; each project presents a challenging creative task without ready-made solutions, where no advice is universally valid, and no one is immune to mistakes or failures.  </p> <p>Conversely, Yevhen Lamakh, playing senior sailor Mishka in Timur Yashchenko\u2019s \u201cCherkasy\u201d (2014), achieved impressive results in understanding and portraying his character, despite his youth.  </p> <p> Yevhen Lamakh as a senior sailor Mishka in Timur Yashchenko\u2019s \u201cCherkasy\u201d (2014). </p> <p>Mishko emerged as a complex and captivating figure:  </p> <ul> <li>Initially presented as a thoughtless village hooligan drawn to the navy for its allure,  </li> <li>By the end of the film, he transforms into a tragic hero from a nation that has chosen not to defend itself against Russian aggression in 2014.  </li> </ul> <p>Mishko becomes entwined in crucial historical events that shape his character.  </p> <p>Importantly, director Timur Yashchenko sidesteps excessive pathos and propaganda by showcasing the unpleasant aspects of daily life; each character in his film possesses flaws that balance their heroic portrayals.  </p> <p>Yevhen Lamakh also takes on a more ornamental role as student Andriy Savytskyi in Oleksiy Shaparev\u2019s \u201cKruty 1918\u201d (2019), which feels too ordinarily directed\u2014akin to a costume drama where Kyiv students engage in artificial dialogues more suitable for puppet theater than for a story about Ukrainian heroes.  </p> <p> Yevhen Lamakh as a student Andriy Savytskyi in Oleksiy Shaparev\u2019s \u201cKruty 1918\u201d (2019). </p> <p>Their lines appear as clumsy and forced as the French accents of counter-spies played by Ukrainian actors.  </p> <p>Oksana Cherkashyna portrays Tetyana, a combat medic hardened by the brutality of war, in Natalia Vorozhbyt\u2019s \u201cBad Roads\u201d (2020).  </p> <p>This film captivates with its unique and unprecedented precision in capturing on-screen events.  </p> <p> Oksana Cherkashyna as a combat medic Tetyana in Natalia Vorozhbyt\u2019s \u201cBad Roads\u201d (2020). </p> <p>It feels as though the director timed every scene with a stopwatch during filming, with:  </p> <ul> <li>Intricate angles </li> <li>Carefully crafted intonations </li> <li>Every dialogue serving the purpose of engrossing the audience </li> </ul> <p>The audience almost feels submerged in the action. </p> <p>For instance, during Tetyana\u2019s poignant recollections about her deceased lover, the background of vulgar pop music makes her words feel much closer to reality.  </p> <p>It creates the impression that it is not Oksana Cherkashyna speaking, but rather, combat medic Tetyana, blurring the lines between performance and documentary.  </p> <p>A notably powerful moment occurs when she sings a banal yet melodramatic song by a Russian pop singer Tanya Bulanova\u2014its unexpected presence within a film about wartime heroism is both poignant and artistically justified.  </p> <p>Marina Klymova also delivers a strong performance in the film as journalist Yulia, taken captive by the terrorist Stas.  </p> <p>In her portrayal, every line, exclamation, whimper, and sudden fainting spell is so calculated and precise that it resonates like a symphony.  </p> <p>Natalya Polovynka, cast as the mother of missing military pilot Sofia Kulyk in Zaza Buadze\u2019s \u201cMothers of the Apostles\u201d (2020), embodies the stereotypical image of a soldier\u2019s mother at war, willing to do anything for her child.  </p> <p> Natalya Polovynka as the mother of missing military pilot Sofia Kulyk in Zaza Buadze\u2019s \u201cMothers of the Apostles\u201d (2020). </p> <p>Sofia ventures into occupied Donbas, where she encounters:  </p> <ul> <li>Stereotypical terrorists </li> <li>A stereotypical alcoholic woman </li> <li>A stereotypical journalist on television </li> </ul> <p>At one point, the viewer may feel as if they are not watching a film, but rather an engaging computer game titled \u201cSurvive and Escape from the DPR\u201d<sup>5</sup>.  </p> <p>In this film, Natalya Polovynka does not act in the traditional sense; instead, she meticulously processes the script.  </p> <p>Director Buadze, primarily known for shooting TV commercials and shows\u2014the commercial viability of which is built on rigid stereotypes\u2014employs techniques designed to captivate viewers and, by extension, drive up advertising rates.  </p> <p>It is clear that he is selling this story to the audience using well-established commercial methods, and he succeeds, even if stereotypical art lacks high artistic merit.  </p> <p>It serves as a reflection of its time and can reveal fragments of truth about reality. </p> <p>Comedian Heorhiy Deliev, in the role of terrorist Batianya (Pop) in Serhii Loznytsia\u2019s \u201cDonbas\u201d (2018), proves to be quite organic.  </p> <p> Heorhiy Deliev as terrorist Batianya (Pop) in Serhii Loznytsia\u2019s \u201cDonbas\u201d (2018). </p> <p>All the terrorists in occupied territories are, in essence, clowns, lending a circus-like atmosphere not only to this film but also to the documentary footage emerging from those regions.  </p> <p>The character of \u201ca short-haired, bald man with a gray beard\u201d, who persuades a businessman to give his car to the \u201crebels\u201d, feels authentic in Deliev\u2019s portrayal.  </p> <p>This is partly because director Loznytsia captures the tone of a tale that resembles a cruel and bloody circus staged on Ukrainian land occupied by Russians.  </p> <p>Vyacheslav Dovzhenko, as the commander of the Donetsk Airport<sup>6</sup>defense group with the call sign \"Serpen\" (August) in Akhtem Seitablaev\u2019s \u201cCyborgs\u201d (2017), faced the complex challenge of authentically representing a heroic struggle.  </p> <p> Vyacheslav Dovzhenko as the commander of the Donetsk Airport defense group in Akhtem Seitablaev\u2019s \u201cCyborgs\u201d (2017). </p>"},{"location":"works/faces-of-war/#the-challenge","title":"The challenge:","text":"<ul> <li>Avoiding cheap and clich\u00e9d pathos.  </li> <li>Portraying realistic modern combat.  </li> <li>Balancing historical accuracy and dramatic tension.  </li> </ul> <p>Timur Yashchenko successfully overcame this difficulty in the \u201cCherkasy\u201d movie by selecting the right cast and showing the characters\u2019 disadvantages.  </p> <p>In contrast, Seitablaev opted for a \u201cCounter-Strike\u201d game-like style in his film. </p> <p>This is evident in scenes featuring: - Night raids and shootouts in dark corridors. - Characters using thermal imaging to spot enemies. </p> <p>However, Vyacheslav Dovzhenko delivers an important monologue:  </p> <p>\u201cIn this war, it is not enough to simply follow orders... we must think, love, feel injustice...

The Cheka became infamous for its brutal tactics, including arrests, executions, and the use of forced labor camps. It was a precursor to later Soviet security organizations like the NKVD and the KGB. \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The Hutsuls are an ethnic subgroup of Ukrainians living in the Carpathian Mountains, primarily in western Ukraine. They are known for their distinct traditions, vibrant folk art, music, and unique dialect. The UPA (Ukrayins\u2019ka Povstans\u2019ka Armiya) was a Ukrainian nationalist military organization formed during World War II in 1942. Its primary goal was to fight for Ukrainian independence, resisting both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The UPA used guerrilla warfare tactics and is controversial for its actions, including involvement in ethnic conflicts during the war. It remains a significant symbol of Ukrainian resistance and independence for many Ukrainians. \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Baikove Cemetery (Ukrainian: \u0411\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435) is a historic cemetery memorial in Holosiivskyi District of Kyiv, Ukraine.

From the point of view of the modernist critic, the ideal author should be a revolutionary, but he must create a homogeneous reality: it may be, for example, a revolutionary novel about the victory of a national identity in the territory of a country and abroad. The work must necessarily be about the struggle of identities as broad representations of the mass consciousness. Individual characters should only be temporary embodiments of identities that essentially solve nothing, as opposed to a romantic-realistic ideal where individual identities always solve everything.</p> </li> <li> <p>The post-modernist ideal is based on the skillful application of the various pop-patterns that the author must possess at the highest level and construct the fabric of the work, using the irony to maintain a certain distance, so that the reader does not feel impressed with the self-sufficiency of these patterns, because they are not hands, but only gloves (or glove dolls) that are temporarily worn on the hands.</p> </li> <li> <p>The metamodern ideal is the constant oscillation of the sample, and it is very similar to post-modernism, but there is one very significant difference: for the metamodernist there is no difference between the hands and gloves (between the puppet\u2019s hand and the puppet). All previous designs \u2014 both romantic, realistic, modernist and post-modernist \u2014 have the same value for him and can exist both alternately and simultaneously. It should look like nightmarish chaos, but everyone saves snippets (formerly called interludes) into which the author simply channels the specimens to avoid confusion. In general, metamodenism is a very uncomfortable phenomenon, because it is counterintuitive, does not recognize any hierarchy, and its constant oscillation leads to the fact that it is often not clear what is happening: one wants the author to finally dwell on something alone, but in metamodernism this is simply not possible.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Metamodernism should look like nightmarish chaos, but instead, it preserves snippets, small interludes that prevent confusion.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"works/manifesto/#snippets-in-metamodernism","title":"Snippets in Metamodernism","text":"<p>Snippets, in Wes Anderson\u2019s Moonrise Kingdom, represent a Western cultural phenomenon:</p> <p>Suzy Bishop carries six books she borrowed but never returned:</p> <ol> <li>Shelly and the Secret Universe</li> <li>The Francine Odysseys</li> <li>The Girl from Jupiter</li> <li>Disappearance of the 6<sup>th</sup> Grade</li> <li>The Light of Seven Matchsticks</li> <li>The Return of Auntie Lorraine</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>None of these books actually exist.

The earliest religious inquiries were remarkably similar to modern scientific ones in nearly every aspect\u2014except for their subject matter. For example, Thomas Aquinas, in his Summa Theologica, examines the question of whether multiple angels can simultaneously occupy the same space. (Aquinas 2006)</p> <p>This religious approach has persisted throughout history, influencing even modern scientific inquiry. Every scientific hypothesis, to some extent, carries an element of faith\u2014a legacy inherited from religious thought.</p> <p>Here are three examples of modern scientific concepts that remain unproven, relying on a form of intellectual \"faith\" or deeply intuitive reasoning, much like religious beliefs: the multiverse hypothesis, mathematical platonism and string theory. Indeed, whenever you read about Mathematical Platonism or String Theory, it's hard not to think of those medieval scholastics from old jokes, seriously debating how many angels could comfortably fit on the head of a pin. Clearly, modern scientists have inherited from the medieval monks this remarkable penchant for passionately discussing things they can neither observe nor ever prove.</p> <p>Nevertheless, since the Enlightenment, religion has gradually lost its influence in philosophy and science. A well-known anecdote illustrates this shift: when Napoleon asked the French astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace why God was not mentioned in his Treatise on Celestial Mechanics, Laplace famously replied, \"Je n\u2019ai pas besoin de cette hypoth\u00e8se\" (\"I have no need for that hypothesis\"). </p> <p>One of the last significant attempts at integrating religious elements into philosophy was Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism. He developed a system of thought positioned between realism (which holds that the world exists independently of our perception) and idealism (which asserts that the world is a construct of our perception). According to Kant, human cognition is shaped by \"pure reason\", an innate framework that precedes experience and organizes knowledge into fundamental categories. He argued that through pure reason, independent of sensory experience, one could resolve synthetic problems.</p> <p>Kant\u2019s idea carried a deeply theological undertone, because the only conceivable source of knowledge prior to experience is God. This aligns with Kant\u2019s famous statement: \u201cI had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.\u201d Since knowledge prior to experience cannot be verified empirically, it inevitably remains a matter of faith. \u201dFurthermore, Kant introduced a \"divine\" limitation on human understanding\u2014the concept of the thing in itself (Ding an sich), which exists beyond our perception and remains fundamentally unknowable. This paradox led to criticism from his contemporaries, who mocked his reasoning by asking: If the thing in itself cannot be known, then how did Kant himself come to know about it?</p> <p>Eventually, with the Industrial Revolution, religious influences began to be seen as an obstacle to progress. Some philosophers, like Karl Marx, sought to reshape society through a materialist worldview, while others, like Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857), aimed to discard religion entirely. This shift gave rise to positivism, a philosophical approach that emphasized empirical science and rational inquiry as the only legitimate sources of knowledge (Comte 1853). Thus, Kant\u2019s concept of pure reason was ultimately dismissed, as it came to be regarded as metaphysical speculation and was deemed inadequate for scientific and philosophical inquiry. </p> <p>Comte believed the sciences form a hierarchy (mathematics at the base, then physics, chemistry, biology, and culminating in sociology) and formulated core positivist principles:  empirical observation, scientific method as guide, law-like regularities and rejection of metaphysics.</p> <p>Comte\u2019s positivism was not merely epistemological but had a progressive social vision. He believed that as societies enter the positive stage, they would achieve intellectual unity and social reform. Subsequent events demonstrated that it was merely an illusion. The rapid advancement of science, liberated from the ethical and mystical constraints of religion, contributed to the devastating First World War, where the massive loss of life was largely driven by high-tech weaponry. Subsequent events demonstrated that war itself became a powerful catalyst for technological progress.</p> <p>After the war it was obvious that Comte\u2019s ideas are obsolete and should be revitalized. Thus logical positivism (logical empiricism) of the Vienna Circle came. Logical positivism owes its birth to the final sentence of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921): \u201eWovon man nicht sprechen kann, dar\u00fcber muss man schweigen.\u201c (What cannot be spoken about must be kept silent). This phrase defined the ideology of the movement, which became radical empiricism, formulated in the \"verification principle\": a proposition is meaningful only if it can be definitively verified by empirical observation or is analytically true (true by definition) (Ayer 1936).</p> <p>However, almost immediately, this principle encountered a problem, wittily described in his book Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits by the critique of positivism, the logical atomist Bertrand Russell:</p> <p>\"Our lives are full of expectations which we usually only become aware of when they fail. Suppose you see half a horse at the moment when it comes round a corner; this may interest you very little, but if the second half turns out to belong to a cow rather than a horse, you will in all likelihood experience a state of extreme surprise which will be almost boundless. It must be admitted that such an occurrence is logically quite possible.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the statement \"all swans are white\" holds meaning only as long as no black swan is found. This means that the empirical method of inductive knowledge through enumeration of observed cases cannot be considered reliable.</p> <p>Logical positivism was helped by a critical rationalist Karl Popper, who, in contrast to the verification principle, proposed the principle of falsification. He argued that a theory is scientific only if it can be tested and potentially refuted. In other words, if there is a possibility of finding a black swan, then it is meaningful to assert that all swans are white. </p> <p>This criterion also applies to entire scientific doctrines. For example, Marxism cannot be falsified because one cannot clearly imagine a scenario in which the poor definitively win the class struggle against the rich; thus, it does not meet Popper\u2019s standard of scientific falsifiability. In contrast, theories that can be tested and potentially disproven\u2014like Einstein's theory of relativity\u2014are considered genuinely scientific.</p> <p>Karl Popper proposed the principle of scientific activity by which all science operates today: if a theory passes many tests, it isn\u2019t verified, only \u201ccorroborated\u201d and held tentatively. (Popper 1959) Thus, no theory can be considered definitely true, as it can potentially be refuted.</p> <p>However, this was not the only problem of positivism, as it was impossible to verify the verification principle itself, since it was not a phenomenon of nature\u2014like the previously mentioned set of white swans\u2014but merely a philosophical claim about language (Richardson 2019).</p> <p>Moreover, the supposed rationality of the positivists was further undermined by G\u00f6del\u2019s Two Incompleteness Theorems (1931):</p> <ol> <li>First Incompleteness Theorem: In any sufficiently developed formal system, there exist true statements that cannot be proven within that system.  </li> <li>Second Incompleteness Theorem: No such system can prove its own consistency.</li> </ol> <p>Criticism of positivism continued in the 1950s when Willard Van Orman Quine, in his 1951 paper \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism,\u201d formulated objections against it. The logical positivists inherited from Kant the distinction between analytic (true by definition) and synthetic (confirmed by experience) judgments. Quine rightly pointed out that any analytic judgment consists of elements that are not themselves analytic (Quine 1951). For example, to prove the widely known statement \"All bachelors are unmarried,\" one must first know from experience who bachelors are and what marriage means. Similarly, all arithmetic operations, which Kant considered analytic, are actually not, since understanding them first requires learning arithmetic. </p> <p>By the 1960s, logical positivism gradually dissolved (Thomas 1956). As historian of philosophy Michael Friedman observed, by 1970 the logical empiricist movement was \u201cpretty clearly over,\u201d even if its influence lingered (Richardson 2019). No single \u201cevent\u201d killed logical positivism; rather it was a cumulative loss of credibility as its bold claims were retracted or rebutted (Thomas 1956). Philosophers Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend not only criticized the positivist approach, they called for a reconsideration of the very attitude towards science in general.</p> <p>Thomas S. Kuhn in his book \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions\u201d (1962) noted that the scientific community is extremely conservative, profoundly influenced by social and psychological factors and does not recognize discoveries that go beyond established stereotypes. Alternative theories are not considered because they don\u2019t fit the reigning paradigm\u2019s rules (Kuhn 1970).  </p> <p>Paul Feyerabend took positivist criticism even further. In his 1975 book Against Method, he argued that science cannot have any fixed methodology and does not possess any special claim to truth (Feyerabend 1975). He advocated \"epistemological anarchism\"\u2014the idea that there are no universally valid rules of science\u2014encapsulated in his provocative slogan, \"Anything goes!\" (Feyerabend 1975). From there, postmodernism emerged in full force.</p> <p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this essay, modern science has some features of a religion.  Feyerabend claimed that science is not inherently superior to other modes of knowledge such as myth, religion, but has simply become dominant. He even argued that societies would be healthier if \u201cstate and science\u201d were separated just as we separate church and state, because \u201cscience is a most aggressive and dogmatic religious institution\u201d. (Feyerabend 1975). In books like *Science in a Free Society* (1978), he even entertained relativism, arguing that different cultures may have different truth systems and we have no absolute reason to rank science above ancient myth, except by our own parochial standards (Preston 2020).  </p> <p>In the 1980s postmodernist thinkers extended the critique of positivism and of Enlightenment rationality even further. Thinkers like Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and Michel Foucault, among others, argued that science is not the mirror of nature or the one true path to knowledge, but rather a particular narrative or discourse that is deeply shaped by social, linguistic, and power dynamics (Lyotard 1984; Foucault 1980). Instead, they presented science as socially constructed and as one knowledge system among many, with no claim to ultimate or context-free validity (Lyotard 1984). Lyotard claims that The Enlightenment, Marxism\u2019s theory of history etc. are metanarratives that have lost their credibility. Lyotard argued that no such system can claim to possess objective truth, as all knowledge is inherently fragmented. Grand narratives are not neutral; they are employed by states, institutions, and ideologies to justify their decisions and maintain control over society. (Lyotard 1984). Specifically regarding science, he noted two major metanarratives that guided modernity: </p> <ul> <li>that knowledge (science) is progressively leading us toward total truth and human emancipation, and   </li> <li>that history is moving towards freedom and enlightenment. </li> </ul> <p>Positivism clearly partook in the first narrative\u2014the faith that accumulating empirical knowledge would eventually map reality and improve society (Comte 1853). Postmodernity, Lyotard claimed, is marked by skepticism toward such universalist claims.  He described knowledge in postmodern societies as splintered into multiple language games and contexts. Science is just one \u201clanguage game,\u201d with its own rules (e.g., what counts as a valid scientific statement), but it does not have a privileged claim to represent Truth outside those rules (Lyotard 1984). </p> <p>Michel Foucault stated: \u201cTruth isn\u2019t outside power\u2026 truth is produced by virtue of multiple constraints and induces regular effects of power\u2026 each society has its regime of truth, its \u2018general politics\u2019 of truth: the types of discourse it accepts and makes function as true\u201d (Foucault 1980). In other words, what we call \u201ctruth\u201d (including scientific truth) always bears the imprint of the social rules and institutions that endorse certain statements as true and reject others (Foucault 1980). For positivism, which held that objective observation and reason lead to truth, Foucault\u2019s perspective is a severe critique (Richardson 2019). It implies that objectivity itself is a social construct\u2014what counts as objective is defined by a community\u2019s norms and training (Foucault 1980). </p> <p>A typical example of Lyotard and Foucault's concept of power-biased postmodern science is Elon Musk's influence and activity. He uses science for his ventures (SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink) to promote techno-utopianism, positioning science as the solution to humanity\u2019s crises\u2014a legitimizing discourse consolidating corporate and political influence. By owning X (Twitter), he controls narratives, amplifies right-wing voices, and influences political discourse. Musk's direct involvement in geopolitics surfaced in a Twitter skirmish with Polish FM Sikorski over Starlink for Ukraine. </p> <p>This meta-narrative approach has advanced to the point where, unlike positivists who claimed that a successful experiment reveals a fact of nature, constructivists now argue that the validity of an experiment depends on the authority of the experimenters. (Richardson 2019). Extreme versions even would say scientific knowledge is just the result of interests and negotiations (Lyotard 1984). This raises the question: does truth established in this way remain truth, or does it become something else entirely? The answer is obvious: everyone prefers their own version of truth and would never admit that their truth is less valid than someone else's. This essay began with religion, which gradually evolved into science, but now postmodernists argue that science itself is merely another form of religion or even self-delusion..</p> <p>One notable example highlighting how easily the academic community can be misled was the Sokal affair in 1996, when physicist Alan Sokal successfully published a deliberately absurd article, \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,\" in the humanities journal Social Text. He later revealed his hoax to expose postmodern academia\u2019s tendency to adopt meaningless scientific jargon. A similar but broader attempt, \"Sokal Squared\" (2017\u20132018), involved Peter Boghossian, James Lindsay, and Helen Pluckrose, who submitted numerous nonsensical papers to respected journals, again revealing ideological bias and vulnerability to pseudointellectual content in contemporary scholarship. It\u2019s broadly accepted that scientists are humans with biases, that scientific institutions have agendas, and that social values can shape research questions and applications (Foucault 1980). </p> <p>This devastating approach to science was not halted but slightly tempered by the post-positivist reaction. Thinkers like Popper, Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and others can all be considered post-positivist in that they move beyond the naive verifications of early positivism but do not embrace a full relativism that denies the value of science (Popper 1959; Kuhn 1970; Lakatos 1970). Here are some of the main post-positivist principles: </p> <ul> <li>All theories could be disproven by future observations; none could be known as absolutely true; our picture of the world is always incomplete (Popper 1959).   </li> <li>A hypothesis isn\u2019t verified or falsified outright; rather, evidence raises or lowers our degree of confidence. Peer review, replication, and community consensus is crucial in warranting scientific knowledge. Debate, critique, collaboration help mitigate individual biases  (Richardson 2019).   </li> <li>Contemporary philosophy of science often treats theories as models of the world rather than one-to-one mirrors. Theoretical terms are human constructs that may only apply in certain domains or under certain approximations. (Suppe 1974).   </li> <li>Science advances by solving problems rather than approaching truth in a straightforward way (Laudan 1977).  </li> <li>Scientists work within research programs that have a \u201chard core\u201d of fundamental assumptions and a \u201cprotective belt\u201d of auxiliary hypotheses that can be adjusted. A progressive research program predicts novel facts and expands, whereas a degenerating one only patches itself to accommodate known problems (Lakatos 1970). </li> </ul> <p>After all these post-positivism observations, it was quite natural to expect a new form of knowledge\u2014and it came. We call it post-truth. Post-truth describes a cognitive state where emotions and beliefs override facts, making factual refutation nearly impossible. Philosophers have long noted this: the Duhem-Quine thesis suggests any theory can be shielded from contradiction with enough added assumptions\u2014explaining why flat-earthers in space might dismiss their experience as an AI-generated illusion.</p> <p>Classical epistemology focuses on individual knowledge, but post-truth is a societal condition. In a complex world, no one can be an expert in everything, so people rely on social knowledge shaped by groups, institutions, and shared values. Truth depends less on evidence and more on affiliations, trust, and community narratives.</p> <p>This is why certain political claims, no matter how false, are embraced by specific groups. If a public figure declares that immigrants eat cats and dogs, some will believe it\u2014not from malice, but because they trust the source. Ironically, such a figure might even run a social network called Truth, reinforcing the post-truth cycle.</p> <p>The rise of social media has dismantled the epistemic structures that once defined the \u201cnormal world\u201d of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Previously, reputable media, universities, and research institutions shaped knowledge, refining it over time. While imperfect, this system served humanity well. Today, expertise has eroded, replaced by Twitter-like platforms where popularity, not accuracy, drives discourse, fragmenting our understanding of truth.</p> <p>As traditional institutions weaken, access to information has skyrocketed, yet truth-validation has never been shakier. This paradox challenges how societies define knowledge in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Meanwhile, philosophy of science grapples with AI\u2019s role in discovery. Simulations in climate science or astrophysics, once considered secondary to direct observation, now yield valid data (Richardson 2019).</p> <p>By 2025, AI also raises questions about whether discovery is uniquely human and highlights biases in machine learning, where flawed data can reinforce systemic errors (O\u2019Neil 2016). While AI reshapes epistemic practices, it hasn\u2019t replaced human judgment\u2014only shifted it to designing, fine-tuning, and monitoring AI, demanding new frameworks to ensure sound knowledge production.</p> <p>And so, after centuries of chasing truth, we\u2019ve arrived at a world where AI generates scientific papers, Twitter polls decide reality, and philosophers debate whether knowledge still exists at all. Comte\u2019s positivism, Popper\u2019s falsification, and Foucault\u2019s power dynamics now compete with deepfakes and influencer \u201cresearch.\u201d Perhaps science was just another metanarrative, or maybe we\u2019ve simply upgraded from counting angels on needles to counting likes on hot takes. Either way, the post-truth era has spoken: the loudest voice wins, and reality is whatever gets the most engagement.</p>"},{"location":"works/struggle-for-reality/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Aquinas 2006: Aquinas, Thomas.
